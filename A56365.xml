            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>The Meritorious Price OF MANS REDEMPTION, OR Chriſts Satisfaction diſcuſſed and explained.</p>
            <p n="1">1 By ſhewing how the Sufferings and the Sacrifice of Chriſt, did ſatisfie Gods Juſtice, pacifie his Wrath, and procure his Reconciliation for mans Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from Satans Head-plot.</p>
            <p n="2">2 By vindicating the Sufferings and the Sacrifice of Chriſt, from that moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Scripture-leſs Tenen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, that is held forth by Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> of <hi>New England</hi> in his Book of <hi>Chriſts Sufferings,</hi> affirming that he ſuffered the Eſſential Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell, and the ſecond death from Gods immediate vindicative wrath.</p>
            <p n="3">3 By ſhewing that the Righteouſneſs and Obedience of Chriſt in relation to his Office of Mediatorſhip, is a diſtinct ſort of obedience, from his moral obedience, in Chapter the third and elſewhere.</p>
            <p n="4">4 By ſhewing that the Righteouſneſs of God (ſo called in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21, 22, 26 in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. and in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9.) is to be underſtood of God the Fathers performance of his Covenant with Chriſt; namely, that upon Chriſts performance of his Covenant (by combating with Satan, and at laſt by making his death a ſacrifice) he would be reconciled to beleeving ſinners, and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute their ſins to them. And therefore 1. This Righteouſneſs of God muſt needs be the formal cauſe of a ſinners juſtification. And 2. It muſt needs be a diſtinct ſort of Righteouſneſs from the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, contrary to Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> Tenent. This is evidenced in Chap. 14. and elſewhere.</p>
            <p n="5">5 By explaining Gods Declaration of the combate between the Devil and the ſeed of the woman in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. from whence (as from the foundation-principle) this preſent Reply doth explain all the after prophecies of Chriſts Sufferings.</p>
            <p n="6">6 By clearing ſeveral other Scriptures of the greateſt note in theſe Controverſies, from Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> corrupt Expoſitions, and by expounding them in their right ſenſe; Both according to the Context, and according to ſundry eminent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Writers.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Humbly preſent this inſuing Controverſie to your Honor, becauſe I deem you to be an able Judge, not onely in thoſe Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies that concern the common Laws of this Land; but alſo in Divine Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and eſpecially in this inſuing Controverſie, becauſe it hath ſo much dependance on ſundry ſorts of Scripture-Laws and Covenants, in all which you cannot chuſe but have a judicious inſpection, as well as into the Laws of this Land; and the rather, becauſe the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> have either in their riſe, or in their uſe, ſome relation to the ſaid Scripture Laws and Covenants.</p>
            <p n="1">1 This inſuing Controverſie hath ſome relation to the moral Law of Nature, in which <hi>Adam</hi> was created. And this Law, though I call it the moral Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet I do not call it the Covenant of Nature, which God made with <hi>Adam</hi> touching mans nature in general, as my Opponent doth.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It hath ſome relation to that ſpecial poſitive Law and
<pb facs="tcp:64895:3"/>
Covenant which God made with <hi>Adam</hi> (concerning mans nature) as he was ordained to be the head of mans Nature in general; For God gave unto <hi>Adam</hi> two ſymbolical Trees, unto which he annexed a Promiſe as well as a threatning, namely, <hi>That in caſe he did firſt eat of the Tree of Life, then his Promiſe and Covenant</hi> (which was neceſſarily implyed) <hi>was, That he and all his natural poſterity ſhould be confirmed in his created natural perfections for ever; But in caſe he did firſt eat of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, then his threatning was, That both he and all his natural poſterity ſhould die a spiritual death in ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 It hath ſome relation to the Laws of a Combate for the trial of the maſtery; for at the firſt the Devil thought that he had got the ful victory over all mankind by drawing <hi>Eve</hi> to eat of the forbidden fruit; but God told the Devil in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. That he would put an utter enmity between him and the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed of that woman which he had deceived and conquered, and that one of her ſeed ſhould combate with him, and break his cunning Head-plot, by continuing conſtant in his obedience, through all his ill uſage; until he had made his ſoul a ſacrifice of Reconciliation. And moreover, God told the Devil, that he ſhould have his full liberty to provoke his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to hinder him in the courſe of his obedience, by his ill uſage, and that he ſhould have ſo much power granted him, as to pierce him in the foot-ſaols for a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Male factor on the croſs, to try if by any ill uſage, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by fraud or force, he could provoke his patience to make him ſin againſt the Laws of the Combate. And God alſo warned the Devil by his proclamed Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That in caſe he could not prevail by all his ill u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to diſturb the paſſions of the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, nor any other way to divert him in the courſe
<pb facs="tcp:64895:3"/>
of his obedience, then this ſeed of the woman (by the onely weapon of his righteouſneſs) ſhould break his Head-plot in peeces, and ſo ſhould get the victory of the Victor; and reſcue the ſpoil from his power (or at the leaſt the beſt part of the ſpoil) namely, the Elect; and ſo it was prophecied of this bleſſed ſeed, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 12. <hi>That he ſhould divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong,</hi> namely with the ſtrong enemy Satan.</p>
            <p n="4">4 It hath ſome relation to the Laws of the Eternal Covenant, between the Father and the Son for mans Redemption; for God could not have declared the ſaid Laws of the Combate for the Victory, except there had gone before hand an eternal conſent, decree and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between the Father and the Son, for the trial of this Combate, in order to the redemption of the Elect from Satans head-plot: Therefore from this declared combate, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. it follows by neceſſary conſequence, that the ſecond perſon did from eternity Covenant to take unto him mans true nature from the ſeed of the deceived ſinful woman, and in that nature, as it was accompanied with our true infirmities of Fear, Sorrow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to enter the Liſts, and to combate with Satan for the end aforeſaid. And 2. Hence it alſo follows by neceſſary conſequence, That God the Father did Covenant to and with his Son, that in caſe the Devil could not by all his ill uſage prevail to diſturb his humane paſſions, nor could by any other way divert him in the courſe of his obedience, until he had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed all his ſufferings, and until at laſt, in that obedience, he had made his ſoul a ſacrifice, then he would accept of the perfection of his righteouſneſs and obedience, both in his combate and alſo in the formality of his death, by his own Prieſtly power, as a ſweet ſmelling ſacrifice, and thereupon would be reconciled to the Elect, and receive them again into ſpecial favor, as Sons, by Adoption.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fundamental grounds of Chriſtianity, do inforce us to grant, That in the Divine nature (though moſt indiviſibly one) there is an eminent Ideal pattern, of ſuch a diſtinction as we call between party and party, a capacity to give, and a capacity to receive; a capacity to demand, and a capacity to ſatisfie &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 From this eternal Decree and Covenant between the Father and the Son, doth reſult the New Covenant with the Elect; For it pleaſed them to agree, That all the Articles of the New Covenant, ſhould be ratified and confirmed to the Elect by the death of Chriſt, and from that confirmation by his death; It is now ſtiled the New Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15, 16.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Preſently after the Declaration of the ſaid En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and Combate in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. namely, in verſe 19. It pleaſed God further to declare the Council of his will to fallen (but now alſo converted) <hi>Adam,</hi> That he ſhould return to the duſt whence he was taken, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
            <p>And this is alſo further to be noted, That God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced this judicial ſentence of a bodily death on him, as a juſt puniſhment for his original ſpiritual death in ſin; and this is alſo further evident by <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, The Apoſtle doth alſo further tell us, That when God appointed a bodily death to <hi>Adams</hi> ſinful nature, that he alſo did at the very ſame time appoint a judgement for each departed ſoul, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27. namely,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That ſuch as dyed in the faith of their Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the ſeed of the woman, ſhould bee judged to
<pb facs="tcp:64895:4"/>
everlaſting life; and ſo the ſentence of their bodily death ſhould at the laſt bee turned into a bleſſing to them.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, That ſuch as beleeved nor their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by this ſeed of the woman, the ſentence of their bodily death ſhould bring a greater judgement to them, becauſe it ſhould be an inlet to their eternal death in hell, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 36.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Hence it alſo follows by neceſſary conſequence, That when God proclaimed this Combate and victory, he did exemplifie the manner of the victory to <hi>Adam</hi> by the death of ſome Lamb, which God commanded <hi>Adam</hi> to offer in Sacrifice (as I have ſhewed it more at large in my Treatiſe of the Inſtitution of the Sabbath) and ever after, God did exemplifie the ſame to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, both before, and after the Flood.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Before the Flood, it is ſaid, That <hi>Abel</hi> did offer a better ſacrifice than <hi>Cain,</hi> becauſe he offered it in faith, <hi>Gen. 4. Heb.</hi> 11. 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Immediately after the Flood, <hi>Noah</hi> is ſaid to offer ſacrifice for a ſweet ſavor of reſt unto God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 21. becauſe ſuch Sacrifices were ordained to typifie Gods full reſt, and ſweet content in the perfect obedience of Chriſt; firſt in his Combate, and at laſt in his Sacrifice, as it is opened in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 2.</p>
            <p n="3">3 After this, God is ſaid to preach the Goſpel unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gal. 3. 8, 16. and how elſe did he preach the Goſpel, but by declaring in what manner the Seed of the woman ſhould break the Serpents Head plot? and therefore when God renewed his Promiſe and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of bleſſedneſs to <hi>Abraham</hi> (by telling him that this Seed of the woman ſhould come out of his loyns) He gave this Teſtimony of <hi>Abraham, That he
<pb facs="tcp:64895:5"/>
did obey his voyce, and keep his charge, his Commandements, his Statutes, and his Laws,</hi> Gen. 26. 5. <hi>And that he would teach his children and his houſhold after him</hi> (as all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers did) <hi>to keep the way of the Lord, Gen.</hi> 18. 19. namely, to keep the way of true Religion, or the way of Redemption by the Seed of the woman, that was promiſed to come out of his loyns.</p>
            <p n="4">4 After this, it pleaſed the Lord to ſeparate <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be his peculiar people in Covenant; And then at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> he gave them the ten Commandements, as a Covenant of Grace (as many learned Divines do of late rightly call it) for the regulating of their faith and obedience, in the courſe of their lives, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with certain other voluntary, ceremonial and typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Laws, and with certain Judicial Laws (many of which were alſo typical) and theſe Laws in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bodily uſe were called the firſt Covenant (of works) in reſpect of their lawful and legal appearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods preſence in his Sanctuary, but the ſame Laws in their myſtical and ſpiritual uſe were given as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, and as the Law of faith, though after a while, the <hi>Jews</hi> under the New Teſtament, did miſtake Gods end in giving them, for they did relye upon their outward obedience to them as Idolaters do, for their eternal juſtification and ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Beſides theſe typical ceremonial Laws, It pleaſed God to ordain ſome other voluntary, poſitive, ceremonial Laws (which were no way typical in relation to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Chriſt as the former were) but were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained only for the trial of ſome particular mans obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in ſome one particular act; and ſuch was the command of God to <hi>Saul</hi> to deſtroy the <hi>Amalekites</hi> ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, without ſparing any thing, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. And ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:64895:5"/>
alſo was the command of God to <hi>David,</hi> to hang up ſeven of <hi>Sauls</hi> ſons to pacifie his wrath, though ſome of them, if not all of them, might be innocent of <hi>Sauls</hi> ſin, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. And ſuch alſo was the command of God to the young Prophet, not to eat any bread in that place, nor to return the ſame way that he came, 1 <hi>King. 13. 9. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>

                  </gap>eſt ſenſe of the bleſſed Scriptures in theſe inſuing Controverſie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Paul <hi>did much commend the Synagogue of the</hi> Bercans, <hi>for their better, more noble, and more ingenuous diſpoſition (beyond the Synagogue of the</hi> Theſſalonians) <hi>becauſe they ſearched the Scriptures daily whether thoſe things were ſo or no, as</hi> Paul <hi>had taught in their Synagogue,</hi> Act. 17. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For in two main points of Religion touching mans Redemption, which</hi> Paul <hi>taught in their Synagogue) he differed much from their common received opinion:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For firſt, hee opened and alledged from the Scriptures, That the Meſsiah muſt needs have ſuffered (namely, that by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity of the eternal Decree and Covenant, he muſt needs take on him our true humane nature from the Seed of the woman, and that in that nature as it was accompanied with our true humane affections and paſsions, he muſt needs enter the Liſts and Combate with Satan for the victory, for God had proclaimed an utter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity between them in</hi> Gen. 3. 15.) <hi>and then he alſo told the Devil that he ſhould have full liberty and power to peirce this Seed of the woman in the foot-ſoals, as a ſinful Malefactor on the Croſs,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64895:6"/>
               <hi>And ſecondly, Hee opened and alledged from the Scriptures, That the Meſsiah muſt alſo of neceſsity riſe again from death to life on the third day,</hi> Act. 17. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In theſe two main points,</hi> Paul <hi>differed much from the common received opinion of the</hi> Jews; <hi>for their common received opinion was, That their Meſsiah ſhould come into the world as a ſtately conquering Monarch, to redeem them from the Tyranny of the Nations of the world and to reſtore them again into their own land, in a more glorious manner than ever before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſecondly, it was their common opinion, that their Meſsiah ſhould not dye at all, but that he ſhould continue alive for ever in his ſtately monarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This was their common received opinion of Redemption by the Meſsiah, as it is evident by</hi> Joh. 12, 23, 32. 34. <hi>and by</hi> Jonathans <hi>Paraphraſe, and by their</hi> Thalmud, <hi>which is cited by</hi> Maymony, <hi>and tranſlated by Mr.</hi> Bro. <hi>in</hi> Eccleſ. <hi>p. 31. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therefore when</hi> Paul <hi>opened and alledged from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that the Meſsiah muſt needs have ſuffered from Satan and his Inſtruments for their redemption, it was a great ſtumbling block of offence to the</hi> Jews <hi>in general,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 23. <hi>and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſome few of their</hi> Hebrew <hi>Doctors held and wrote otherwiſe, namely, That the Meſsiah muſt ſuffer much evil from the enmity of Satan; For ſaith</hi> Du Pleſſis <hi>in the Trueneſs of Religion, page 531. Some of the</hi> Rabbins <hi>in the</hi> Thalmud <hi>ſay, That Chriſt ſhould be diſtreſſed as a woman that labors of a child, according as</hi> Jeremy <hi>ſaith, He had great Anguiſhes to ſuffer, but that he would indure them willingly to deliver man from ſin. And (ſaith he)</hi> Rab. Hadarſon <hi>ſaith, That Satan ſhould be an enemy to him, and to his Diſciples. And, ſaith he, in the book of</hi> Ruth, <hi>where it is written,</hi> Eat thy bread, and temper it with vinegar. <hi>This Bread (ſaith the Commentary) is the bread of the anointed King (or Meſsiah) who ſhall be broken for mens ſin, and indure great torments, as it is written in</hi> Iſaiah. <hi>And ſaith he,</hi> Rabbi Symeon Ben Jochai <hi>writeth thus, Wo worth the Murtherers of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>for they ſhall kill Chriſt; God will ſend his Son cloathed in mans fleſh to waſh them, and they will kill him: And ſaith he, Whereas it is ſaid, we be healed by his death (or ſtripes) the ancient</hi> Cabaliſts <hi>underſtand it of Chriſt, and ſay that the Angels had taught them, that the clenſing away of ſin
<pb facs="tcp:64895:7"/>
ſhould be done upon Wood. And ſaith</hi> Du Pleſſis <hi>in page</hi> 478. Rab. Hechadoſh <hi>ſaith, That the Meſsiah ſhall by his death ſave</hi> Adams <hi>race, and deliver mens ſouls from Hell, and therefore hee ſhall be called,</hi> Saviour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſecondly, Some few of the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Doctors did alſo hold the Reſurrection of the Meſsiah; For ſaith</hi> Du Pleſſis <hi>in page</hi> 532, 533. Rab. Hadarſon, <hi>and</hi> Rab. Hachadoſh, <hi>and</hi> Rab. Jonathan <hi>the ſon of</hi> Uzziel, <hi>and others, do expound theſe Texts of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt,</hi> Thou wilt not ſuffer thy holy One to ſee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; And he ſhall be raiſed again within the third day, for it is written, He will quicken us after two dayes, and in the third day will he raiſe us up again: <hi>And ſay the</hi> Rabbins <hi>in</hi> Breſith Rabba <hi>commenting on</hi> Gen. 22. 4. <hi>There are many a three dayes in the holy Scriptures, of which one is the Reſurrection of the Meſsiah, See</hi> Ainſ. <hi>in</hi> Gen. 22. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe two points of Doctrine which was ſcoffed at by the wiſe Philoſophers of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>Act. 17. 18 &amp;c. (which was held but by a very few among the</hi> Jews) Paul <hi>taught to be the only truth in their Synagogues, and he opened and alledged the Scriptures to prove theſe points.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But becauſe theſe points of Doctrine were contrary to their now common received opinion, Therefore the Church or Synagogue of</hi> Theſſalonica <hi>(being foreſt alled by their erronious judgements) were inraged at it, and like mad men, did teoth and nayl perſecute</hi> Paul <hi>for it, but yet he was hid from their rage, and he that held the truth was glad to obſcure himſelf at the preſent, and to haſte away out of their Juriſdiction unto the Juriſdiction of the Synagogue of</hi> Berea; <hi>But when the</hi> Jews <hi>of</hi> Theſſalonica <hi>had knowledge thereof, they ſent thither alſo, and ſtirred up the people againſt</hi> Paul, <hi>verſe 13. becauſe hee hold and taught the ſaid Doctrine there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But although at the firſt it ſeemed very ſtrange, and new, to them of</hi> Berea, <hi>as it did to them of</hi> Theſſalonica, <hi>yet they did not perſecute</hi> Paul <hi>for it, becauſe the chief Rulers there were of a more wiſe, temperate and noble diſpoſition than they of</hi> Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica, <hi>and therefore they took a wiſer courſe;</hi> For they ſearched the Scriptures daily, whether thoſe things were ſo or no: <hi>And this is worthy of all due conſideration, that they did not content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a ſuperficial ſearch of one day and away, but they
<pb facs="tcp:64895:7"/>
made it their daily work to ſearch the Scriptures, neither did they truſt only to the Expoſitions of thoſe</hi> Hebrew <hi>Doctors that were now commonly received, but they ſearched into the Scriptures themſelves, conferring what</hi> Paul <hi>had taught, and his proofs, with the Doctrine of</hi> Moſes, <hi>and the Prophets, held forth in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 19. <hi>concerning the promiſed Meſsiah where the firſt Scripture to be examined is in</hi> Gen. 3. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And firſt, By this means</hi> Pauls <hi>two points of Doctrine which ſeemed new to them, at the firſt ſhew, was found by them to be the only true Doctrine of the bleſſed Scriptures; and by that means many of them beleeved the ſaid points, with many honourable wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which were</hi> Greeks, <hi>and of men not a few, verſe</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, By this means</hi> Pauls <hi>new Doctrine (in ſhew) eſcaped the</hi> odium <hi>of Hereſie in this place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, By this means the Synagogue of</hi> Berea <hi>eſcaped from being ranked by the holy Ghoſt in the number of the other inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged zealous perſecutors of the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I do earneſtly therefore intreat thee, Good Reader, as thou deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to eſcape the</hi> odium <hi>of a Perſecutor, and as thou deſireſt to have the like commendations with thoſe of</hi> Berea, <hi>ſearch the bleſſed Scriptures, not only ſuperficially, and by ſome common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Expoſitors, but ſearch them deliberately, and ſearch them daily, and then thou ſhalt be the better able to try which of us do give the true ſenſe of the bleſſed Scriptures, for as</hi> Peter <hi>ſaith of</hi> Pauls <hi>Epiſtle to the diſperſed</hi> Hebrews, <hi>ſome things are hard to be underſtood, which they that are unlearned and unſtable wreſt, as they do alſo other Scriptures, to their own deſtruction,</hi> 2 Pet. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16. <hi>and therefore be diligent in thy ſearch, and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Interpreters give variety of interpretations, and therefore look well to the Context, and look well to the force and uſe of the original word, by comparing it with the Context, and with other Scriptures; for when</hi> Paul <hi>went about to convince error, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the truth, he diſputed out of the Scriptures,</hi> Act. 17. 2. <hi>and ſo</hi> Apollos <hi>diſputed out of the Scriptures,</hi> Act. 18. 28. <hi>And our Savior ſaid, Yee erre, not knowing the Scriptures,</hi> Mat. 22. 29. <hi>meaning thereby, that they did erre, becauſe they did miſ-underſtand the Scriptures; for though they knew the letter of the Scriptures, and had them in great reverence, yet they did erre becauſe through a ſuperficial peruſal, they took them in a wrong ſenſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64895:8"/>
               <hi>Now the firſt Scripture wherein the true Plat-form of our Redemption is firſt declared, is</hi> Gen. 3. 15. <hi>In this Scripture God doth firſt proclaim an utter enmity between the ſeed of the Woman and the ſeed of the Serpent; and in that Text God told the Devil, that one of the ſeed of that deceived ſinful Woman, ſhould in his true humane nature try Masteries with him, and conquer him, and he told Satan that he ſhould have his full liberty to do what he could, either by fraud or by force, to hinder this ſeed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man from breaking his Head-plot, and ſo from winning the prize of mans Redemption, and therefore God gave him full liberty to uſe him as a ſinful Malefactor, and to peirce him in the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoals, to try if by any means he could diſturb his patience; And in this Combate Chriſt covenanted that his humane nature ſhould ſtrive lawfully, and not ſuffer his patience to be diſturbed, nor his obedience to be any wayes perverted, until he had finiſhed the Combate with Satan, and then he alſo covenanted in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of that obedience to make his ſoul a ſacrifice for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of Gods Reconciliation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And hence it alſo follows, That God the Father had covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, and with Chriſt, that he would accept his Combate, and his Sacrifice as a valuable conſideration for the procuring of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to all the Elect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thus it was declared that the ſeed of the Woman ſhould break the Devils Head-plot, and win the prize, which was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of all the Elect from Satans ſpoyl.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And firſt, From this Proclamation of Enmity, and from this firſt Declaration of the Combate with Satan, and of the Victory by the ſeed of the deceived Woman in</hi> Gen. 3. 15. <hi>muſt all the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scriptures have reference for their true Expoſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſecondly, From this Scripture it is moſt evident, That all Chriſts outward ſuffering were by Gods appointment to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on him from the malice of Satan, and his Inſtruments; and that all his inward ſufferings in his vital ſoul, were to be aſſumed and exerciſed from his own true humane affections and paſsions (which he took from the ſeed of the Woman) in relation to his ill uſage from his Enemy Satan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thirdly, Neither in this, nor in any following Scripture, is there any mention that Chriſt was to be made a ſinner by Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial imputation, there is no ſuch Court-language in the
<pb facs="tcp:64895:8"/>
Scriptures, neither is the term Hell-torments, nor the ſecond death, nor the term</hi> Inflicted <hi>from Gods immediate wrath, applied to Chriſt, neither in this, nor in any other Scripture, though Mr.</hi> Norton <hi>hath perverted moſt dangerouſly many of the bleſſed Scriptures ſo to ſpeak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, When this firſt Declaration in</hi> Gen. 3. 15. <hi>is rightly underſtood, and conferred with all the other Scriptures that ſpeak of Chriſts ſufferings; it will fully declare, That Mr.</hi> Nortons <hi>Tenents are moſt dangerouſly erronious; and it will confirm the truth of the Dialogue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, This Text of</hi> Gen. 3. 15. <hi>being rightly underſtood will be a general Key to open all the other Scriptures that ſpeak of the ſufferings of Chriſt, in their right ſenſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly, In this Scripture is ſet out both the perſon and office of the Mediator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, The term he relates to his humane nature from the ſeed of the Woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſecondly, The term he relates to his divine nature, or elſe he could not have taken the ſeed of the Woman without original ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, His office is declared to be a Combater with Satan in his humane nature, as it was accompanied with our true humane affections and paſſions. And it was declared, that Satan his envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Combater ſhould have his full liberty to do his worſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke his paſsions, to ſome diſtemper or other, that ſo he might ſpoyl his obedience, and ſo hinder him from making his ſoul a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as it is further declared in this Reply.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Good Reader, Let this eminent example of theſe ingenuous</hi> Bereans, <hi>make thy ſpirit calm and deliberate, to ſearch into the bleſſed Scriptures daily, whether of us have given the right ſenſe, that error may be avoided, and that the truth may be imbraced, and confirmed to thy ſoul, and to the Church of God, when we are dead and gone.</hi>

            <p>AFter I had finiſhed my Reply to Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> and after a good part of it was printed, I received a Book lately publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Anthony Burges,</hi> called, <hi>The true Doctrine of Iuſtification, the ſecond Part,</hi> wherein I found that he hath oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome things in my Book of the <hi>Meretorious Price;</hi> but yet with a differing ſpirit from Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> for he profeſſeth that he likes not to be ſo deep in cenſuring, as he ſees ſome others are.</p>
            <p n="1">1 In page 407. He doth oppoſe the Dialogue, becauſe it diſtinguiſheth between Chriſts legal and Mediatorial obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; But in Chap. 3. and elſewhere, I have juſtified the ſaid diſtinction to be ſound and good.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In page 426. He doth oppoſe the Dialogue, becauſe it makes the formality of Chriſts death and ſacrifice to be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, and in this point his anſwer is almoſt in Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> expreſſions, and therefore my Reply in Chap. 17.

            <p n="4">4 There is one Scripture in my following Reply, which I have cited to my ſenſe, out of Mr. <hi>Burges</hi> in <hi>Vindiciae legis,</hi> namely, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 17, 18. which he doth now expound in a differing ſenſe from what he had done in <hi>Vindiciae legis;</hi> namely, That Chriſt came to fulfil the Law for our righteouſneſs by Gods imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

And ſaith he, foraſmuch as there are two ſignifications of this word Juſtifie; namely, either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, or in account and eſtimation (for God is the Author of either of them) whether of theſe two ſhall we follow in the point of Juſtification propoſed? Forſooth (ſaith he) the latter, (namely, that God doth juſtifie by account and eſtimation) and this, I ſuppoſe, (ſaith he) is ſufficient touching the declaration of this word Juſtification: And, ſaith he, in anſwer to the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in p. 388. b. The formal cauſe is the Juſtice of God, not that Juſtice whereby himſelf is juſt, but that which he communicateth to us, whereby we are truly both counted juſt, and alſo are ſo indeed; For <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth that Juſtification doth conſiſt herein, that our ſins are forgiven us, and that they are no more imputed to us.

               <p>Diſorderly and irregular fear and grief, doth ſometimes prove lethal and deadly; but it is dangerous to affirm the ſame of Chriſts regular fear and grief.

But it is moſt dangerous to make Chriſts ſoul-ſorrows to be lethal and deadly after this manner; for ſaith <hi>Damaſen,</hi> His paſſions never prevented his (regular) will; neither might his death be effected by natural cauſes, but by his own Prieſtly power, or elſe it could not be a Sacrifice.</p>

                  <div n="1" type="reason">
                     <head>My firſt Reaſon is this.</head>
                     <p>If God made a Covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> concerning his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <note place="margin">The firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was not made in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Adams</hi> obedience or diſobedience to the Moral law of nature, but in relation to his obedience or diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand about things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in their own nature.</note> or diſobedience about his eating of the two Trees; the one called the Tree of Life, and the other the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, (which was indifferent to be eaten, or not eaten in their own nature) then the firſt Covenant was not made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his obedience or diſobedience to the Moral Law of Nature; unleſſe Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> will affirm that God made two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants of works with <hi>Adam</hi> in his Innocency, of a differing nature, the one of poſitive, and the other of moral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
                     <p>But it is abſurd to affirm, that God made two Covenants of works with <hi>Adam</hi> of ſuch a differing nature.</p>
                     <p>Therefore one of the two muſt needs be null; But the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant concerning the two Trees cannot be null; becauſe that Covenant is expreſſed in the Text; therefore hence it follows that the moral Law of nature was not propounded to <hi>Adam</hi> as the firſt Covenant of works, with the promiſe of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and life in caſe of legal obedience, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> affirmeth upon Scriptures miſ-interpreted; and on this ſandy founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he builds the greateſt part of his Anſwer to the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Covenant was made with <hi>Adam</hi> concerning mans nature in general (as he was the head of all mankind) and that Covenant was this, Eat of the Tree of life in the firſt place (for I have ordained it as thou mayeſt perceive by the name given

to it) for the confirmation of thy created natural perfections to thee, and to all thy ſeed for ever, as theſe places conferred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether do prove, <hi>Gen. 1. 29. Gen. 2. 9. Gen 3. 2.

                     <p>Thirdly, ſaith Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> the Lord having reſpect to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of <hi>Adams</hi> Nature, was pleaſed to try this obedience by ſymbolical Precepts: But when the creature ſhould grow to abſolute perfection and unchangeableneſſe, then ſuch ſymbolical Precepts, and outward Seals ſhould ceaſe as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.</p>
                     <p>It is generally granted that the Command concerning the two Trees, was but for the preſent triall of <hi>Adams</hi> obedience: And hence it follows that as ſoon as the triall was made, (which was to be made in the very day of <hi>Adams</hi> creation, for God had determined to finiſh all his Works, both of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and inviſible Creation, both of the earthly, and of the ſpiritual Creation, in ſix dayes, as I have ſhewed at large in the Inſtitution of the Sabbath) then theſe ſymbolical ſigns of the two Trees muſt ceaſe as needleſſe.</p>
                     <p>God was pleaſed to promiſe the confirmation of his preſent natural perfections for one act of obedience; ſo that had <hi>Adam</hi>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:64895:29"/>
but once eaten of the Tree of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>e (as doubtleſſe in wiſdome he would have done before any other fruit, if the Devil had not ſuddenly circumvented him by his Serpentine ſubtilty) he had been confirmed in his created perfections, and all his poſterity with him for ever; and then theſe ſymbolical Precepts ſhould have ceaſed as needleſſe, as we ſee by experience they did ceaſe upon <hi>Adams</hi> once eating of the tree of Knowledge of good and evill; and ſo in like manner they ſhould have ceaſed, in caſe he had but once eaten of the Tree of life; for when a Covenant is once fulfilled, it ceaſeth to be a Covenant any more; for the performer hath the perpetual fruition of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it; and ſo in like ſort, the will of God was, that the once offering of the body of Chriſt ſhould merit the eternal ſalvation of all the Elect, <hi>Heb. 10. 10. Heb. 7. 27. Heb</hi> 9. 28.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, This was the firſt Covenant, ſaith Mr. <hi>Clendon,</hi> wherein there is no mention of obedience to the moral Law. <note place="margin">In his Sermon of Juſtification juſtified. p. 22.</note> Secondly, (ſaith he) <hi>Adam</hi> was under the obedience of the moral Law, before God made any Covenant with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 27. God created man in his own Image; and this Image of God did ſtand in perfect Knowledge, Righteouſneſſe, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, ſo that at the firſt inſtant of <hi>Adams</hi> creation, he was under the obedience of the Moral Law (even before God brought him into Paradiſe, for he was created out of Paradiſe, but the Covenant was not made with him till after he came into Paradiſe) and being created perfect in knowledge, he did perfectly know the eternal will of God, and accordingly he did perfectly obey it: <hi>And it may well be called the Law of nature, but not a Covenant of nature,</hi> becauſe no promiſe of any reward was made to <hi>Adam</hi> for keeping the moral Law; therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience to the moral Law, was not the condition of the firſt Covenant; but it was a neceſſary condition of mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and a neceſſary conſequent of Gods perfection that man was ſo created.</p>

                     <p>When the Woman ſaw that the Tree was good for food, and that it was a deſire to her eyes; yet if then ſhe had but ſtayed her deſire here, and had gone no further, ſhe had not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; For ſuch poſitive Laws as this, do not bind the inward man, but the outward man only.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Take this Inſtance; If a <hi>Jew</hi> had deſired to eat Swines fleſh to ſatisfie his hunger, becauſe it was good food by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet had forborn the act of eating, he had not ſinned againſt the prohibition of the poſitive Ceremonial Law; and therefore that Law did not bind any ſuch perſon to purifie himſelf by waſhing, in regard of his ſaid inward deſire to eat.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Take another Inſtance: It was a Ceremonial ſin, by the Ceremonial law to touch a dead Corps, becauſe it defiled the outward man only, and not becauſe it defiled the conſcience; for it was a neceſſary duty that was laid upon the conſcience, at leaſt upon ſome of his near relations, not only to deſire, but really to touch his dead Corps, and to carry it to its bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Saith Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> The Law of God becauſe it is holy <note place="margin">In Chriſts dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at Aſſer. 5. p. 141.</note> and ſpiritual, doth require a conformity in all the inclinations and motions of our ſoul, and the Law of nature; but an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute conformity between all our inclinations, and every po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive command of God, ſuch as was the Lords Command that Chriſt ſhould dye for ſinners, is not required in the Law of God.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Adam</hi> (ſaith he) had ſubmitted his natural hunger and deſire to eat of the forbidden fruit, and had not eaten, there had been no ſinful jarring between his will and Gods poſitive Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt not eat of the Tree of knowledge of good and evil.</hi>

And at <hi>Aſſer. 4. page</hi> 140. he ſaith thus; A conditional and ſubmiſſive deſire, though not agreeable to a poſitive Law and Command of God, is no ſin; nor doth the Law (poſitive) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a conformity in our inclinations and firſt motions of deſire.</p>
                     <p>Gods Command to <hi>Abraham</hi> (ſaith he) to kill his only Son, and to offer him a ſacrifice to God, was a meer poſitive Command; for it is not a command of the Law of Nature (nor any other then poſitive) for the Father to kill the Son; yet if <hi>Abrahim</hi> do ſtill retain a natural inclination of love (commanded alſo in the Law of nature) to ſave his Sons life, and doth deſire that he may ſtill live, this deſire and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though it be contradictory to a poſitive Command of God, is no ſin, becauſe the fifth Commandement, grounded on the Law of nature, did command it.</p>
                     <p>And Chriſts deſire that the Cup might paſſe from him was <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 39.

Luke</hi> 22. 42. becauſe the Command that he ſhould lay down his life was not a moral Command (as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> holds) but a poſitive command, and that command (ſaith he) did never root out his natural deſire to preſerve his own life, ſeeing he ſubmitted his deſire to Gods will. And ſaith he in page 217. The Articles of the Covenant between the Father and the Son are diverſly propounded; but at thirdly, ſaith he, the Father bargains by way of work, or hire, or wages, to give a ſeed to his Son, <hi>Eſ. 53. 10. When he ſhall make his ſoul an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his Seed, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> in oppoſition to the Dialogue, affirmeth, That Gods Command to Chriſt to lay down his life, was a moral Command, and that Chriſts obedience thereto was an obedience to the moral Law, in page 57. &amp;c. And though he doth often cite <hi>Rutherford</hi> for him, yet in this he is point blank againſt him.</p>
                     <p>Theſe conſiderations taken from theſe Ceremonial Laws, and ſundry ſuch like which might be produced from ſundry other poſitive Laws, do prove that <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned not in ſoul, but in body only, at firſt, by his actual eating of the forbidden fruit, by which ſinfull bodily act, his body was originally defiled with a contagious ſinful nature, and then his ſoul was defiled
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64895:32"/>
with that contagion, by reaſon of its perſonal union with his body; juſt in the ſame manner as the infuſed ſouls of children are ever ſince. We ſay not (ſaith <hi>Peter Martyr)</hi> that the ſoul is corrupted of the body by a natural action; but for as much as <note place="margin">See P. <hi>Mar.</hi> in Rom. 5. 18. and in his Com. Pl. <hi>part 2 cap. 1. Sect.</hi> 26. and <hi>Zanchy Tract. Theol c 4. de peccato origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</hi>
                        </note> the body is corrupt, it reſiſteth the ſoul, and the ſoul not being confirmed with thoſe gifts which it had in the beginning, obeyeth the inclination thereof, and is governed by it; and therefore hence it follows,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That <hi>Adams</hi> ſin was not a ſin againſt the moral Law, for there is no ſin againſt the moral Law properly, till the ſoul conſent.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Hence it follows, That the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> bodily ſin was not imputed to his ſoul, till his ſoul had firſt received the contagion of his ſin from his body, by vertue of perſonal union, and by vertue of Gods juſtice as a puniſhment on him for the breach of Gods firſt Covenant.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Hence it follows, That Chriſts ſoul could not be made guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> firſt bodily ſin by Gods imputation, except he had been under the ſame Covenant of nature as all the reſt of <hi>Adams</hi> natural poſterity are; and ſo under the ſame obligation to his puniſhment of original death by original ſin.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> moveth this queſtion, How could <hi>Adam,</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after Gods Image, will ſin? <hi>For a good tree cannot bring forth evill fruit.</hi>

                     <p>And Mr. <hi>Clendon</hi> ſaith thus; The moral Law could not be the condition of the firſt Covenant, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> could not <note place="margin">In his Sermon of Juſtification juſtified. p. 23.</note> break the moral Law; he could not ſin directly againſt any branch of the moral Law, becauſe he was created perfect, both in his underſtanding, will, and affections, as all confeſſe; his underſtanding did perfectly apprehend the nature of God, and did perfectly know the will of God in all things contained in the moral Law, and his will and affections did perfectly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the dictates of his underſtanding, and therefore he could not ſin directly againſt the moral Law.</p>
                     <p>And preſently after he ſaith,</p>
                     <p>The liberty of <hi>Adams</hi> will did conſiſt in this, That he could not will any moral evill; and herein he was created after the Image of God (who is the moſt free Agent) and therefore doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes neceſſarily will that, and only that which is good; But about things indifferent in their own nature, he had a liberty to will or nill, to chuſe or refuſe, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>In theſe and ſuch like things her underſtanding was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned (as it was in the knowledge of all moral duties) and therefore in theſe things ſhe being as yet ignorant, might eaſily be ſwayed in her will and affections about things indifferent in their own nature, and therefore ſhe ſeeing that the Tree was good for meat, and a deſire to her eyes, and that it was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to make one more wiſe in the Theory of good and evill, more then ſhe had by Creation, ſhe was perſwaded to take and eat, and then with her hand ſhe reached out ſome of it to her husband, and he ſuſpecting no hurt from her that was given to be a meet helper to him, did take and eat, and then the eyes of them both were opened, not only in the Theory, but alſo in the experience of evil upon themſelves; for now they ſaw and felt their preſent ſpiritual death in ſin.</p>

                        <p n="2">2 Hence it follows, That in caſe the Devil had firſt tempted <hi>Adam</hi> to a moral ſin, he had by that act diſcovered himſelf to <hi>Adam</hi> (as he did to Chriſt) to be naught, &amp; then the Devil had loſt his labour in his temptation, for then <hi>Adams</hi> will would have been governed by his inlightnedmind, and then ſuch tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would have been loathſome to his pure nature, as they were to Chriſt, and then he would have ſaid to Sathan as Chriſt did, <hi>Hence Sathan,</hi> and then Sathan could not have prevailed afterwards; for <hi>Adams</hi> wiſdome was ſuch that he would not have delayed to eat of the Tree of life in the firſt place, as the beſt food for his confirmation.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Hence it follows, That <hi>Adam</hi> did not firſt ſin in ſoul, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> holds, and as indeed he had done, in caſe he had ſinned againſt any branch of the moral Law of nature; but his ſin was only againſt that poſitive Law, that did only forbid his bodily act of eating, as the only breach of the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Hence it follows, That the arguing of the Dialogue in <note place="margin">Original ſin did not fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us for the breach of the moral Law, but for the breach of a poſitive Law and Covenant, about things indifferent in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note>

                        <p n="5">5 Hence it follows, That if <hi>Adam</hi> had but once eaten of the Tree of life (as his wiſdome would have cauſed him to do in the very firſt place, if the Devil had not ſo ſpeedily circumvented him, he had thereby been confirmed in his created perfections and all his poſterity with him; they ſhould have had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated Righteouſneſſe, becauſe God did enter into Covenant

                        <p>The ſafeſt way, is, to hold That God did never ordain the moral Law, neither in <hi>Adams</hi> Innocency; nor ſince his Fall, to be a rule of juſtification by works. See <hi>Wotton de Recon. peccato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris part.</hi> 2. l. 1. c. 6, 7.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, Hence it follows, That ſinners cannot be juſtified formally by Gods imputation of Chriſts obedience to the firſt Covenant of works, unleſſe it can be proved that Chriſt

did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>, to the end that God might impute his fulfilling of the firſt Covenant to us, for our formal juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                        <p>Such abſurd conſequences as theſe will often neceſſarily follow from Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> Doctrine of Gods imputing Chriſts obedience to the firſt Covenant of works for our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>Eighthly, Hence we may learn how to underſtand <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. namely, as by one mans diſobedience to a meer poſitive Law, the <note place="margin">Rom. 5 19</note> Many as well as the reprobate were made ſinners; So by the obedience of one to a meer poſitive Law in his death and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, ſhall the Many be made righteous.</p>
                        <p>Ninthly, Hence it follows, That it is altogether untrue which Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> affirms in his firſt Propoſition, that Chriſt did covenant with his Father, both to fulfill the Law of works, and to ſuffer the eſſential puniſhment of the Curſe, that thereby he might exactly fulfill the firſt Covenant in a way of ſatisfaction to Gods juſtice for mans juſtification.</p>
                        <p>Tenthly, Suppoſe the firſt Covenant was made in relation to the moral Law, (which is not granted, nor cannot be proved) yet in that ſenſe there is an anſwer ready in the words of <hi>Pareus,</hi> That God did never require ſuch a double fulfilling (as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> layes down in his firſt Propoſition) namely that Jeſus Chriſt did enter into a covenant with his Father both to do the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in a way of works, and to ſuffer the eſſential puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Curſe, that ſo he might thereby exactly fulfill the firſt Covenant in a way of ſatisfaction for our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</p>
                        <p>It was never heard (ſaith <hi>Pareus)</hi> that the Law did oblige <note place="margin">In his Epiſt. to <hi>Wbitgenſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> at the end of <hi>vrſinus</hi> Catechiſme p. 797.</note> both to obedience and puniſhment at the ſame time; but every Law obligeth (diſ-junctively, and not copulatively) either to obedience, or to puniſhment; for ſo long as obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is performed, the Law obligeth not to puniſhment; that is, it pronounceth no man guilty of puniſhment; But when obedience is violated, then the Law obligeth the ſinner to puniſhment.</p>
                        <p>This is generally true (ſaith he) both of divine and humane Laws.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="17" facs="tcp:64895:35"/>
Therefore their Suppoſitions (ſaith he) which they do here aſſume, are untrue, and repugnant to Gods juſtice, namely, that man after his Fall (and ſo the Mediator for man) was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged both to fulfill the Law, and to ſuffer puniſhment.</p>
                        <p>When obedience indeed is violated, the ſinner is bound to make ſatisfaction by ſuffering puniſhment: This being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, he is no more a ſinner, and he is tyed to obedience, not to that for the violation of which he hath ſuffered puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but to another new obedience, or if again he violate this, to a new puniſhment.</p>
                        <p>I have cited this of <hi>Pareus</hi> for the ſake of ſuch as hold the true nature of the firſt Covenant to conſiſt in <hi>Adams</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or diſobedience, to the moral Law; and ſo hold as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth, That no ſatisfaction can be made to Gods juſtice, except Chriſt be our ſurety to fulfill the firſt Covenant, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Command in a way of works, and by ſuffering the Eſſential puniſhment of the Curſe in a way of Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                        <p>But I have deſcribed the true nature of the firſt Covenant to lye in <hi>Adams</hi> obedience, or diſobedience, to the poſitive Command only; and ſhewed from the Orthodox, that Chriſts obedience in his Incarnation and Death, was not to the moral law, but to a poſitive Law for ſatisfaction to Gods juſtice for our Redemption and Juſtification.</p>

                  <p>But I muſt needs ſay, I cannot but wonder at his unadviſed citing of this Text, to prove the firſt Covenant of works to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the moral Law of nature; ſeeing it is ſo clear a proof of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words (ſaith Mr. <hi>Ball) Do this and live,</hi> muſt not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted as if they did promiſe life upon a condition of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <note place="margin">Lev. 18. 5.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Do this and live</hi> (ſaith he) what is it more then this, <hi>If ye will obey my voyce, and do my Commandements, ye ſhall be to me a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar treaſure,</hi> Exod. 19. 5. and to this purpoſe he citeth <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 1, 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 1. <hi>James</hi> 1. 25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 6.

                  <p>In like manner (ſaith he) that ſpeech of the Apoſtle, <hi>The Doers of the Law are juſtified,</hi> Rom. 2. 13. may be expounded <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 13.</note> Evangelically; not of them that fulfill the Law to be juſtified by their works, but of them that ſoundly obey, who are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of grace by faith: And hence it appears what works the Apoſtle oppoſeth to faith in the matter of juſtification, not only perfect works done by the ſtrength of nature (of which ſort there be none at all) but works commanded in the Law as it was given to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David</hi> walked in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were effectually called: Theſe works cannot be cauſes together with faith in juſtification.</p>

                  <p>9 The true ſenſe of <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 5. compared with the Context, is this,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Do this and live,</hi> is a general command, and requires obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to all the three ſorts of Laws in <hi>Moſes,</hi> namely, to the Ceremonial and Judicial Laws, as well as to the Moral Law, as the Context doth cleerly evidence by naming all the three ſorts of Laws in theſe three termes, Judgements, Ordinances, and Statutes, wherein they were commanded to walk, namely, in ſanctified obedience, and then the promiſe is added, <hi>Which if a man do, he ſhall live in them,</hi> Lev. 18. 4, 5, 26, 30.</p>
                  <p>The like Command and Promiſe is given for their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the judicial Laws, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 10, 11, 19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 9. and to all their Laws in general, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 1, 10, 31, 32. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 11, 12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 1. 28. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 28.</p>

And this Command in this form of words is often uſed to urge them to the obſervation of the Ceremonial Laws, as <hi>Deu.</hi> 12. 14 32.</p>

                  <p>But becauſe the carnal Jews looked no further in the doing of all this, but to an outward conformity, their ſervices were rejected; whence it is evident, that the Lord commanded the doing of all theſe things in the obedience of faith, and ſo the Lord did expound his mind and meaning to <hi>Cain, If thou do well, ſhalt thou not be accepted?</hi> intimating that well-doing did not conſiſt in an outward form only, nor only in the excellent quality of his offerings which he preſented, but in the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of his heart, in the manner of his offering, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4. and becauſe he wanted faith with his offering, the Apoſtle concludes, that his works were evill, becauſe his good ſacrifices were done in an evill manner for lack of faith.</p>
                  <p>So that Gods Command, <hi>Do this and live,</hi> implies, do it in faith and live, as Chriſt faith in <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 21. <hi>He that doth the will of my Father,</hi> namely that doth it in faith, and then the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is annexed, <hi>This is the will of my Father, that he which beleeveth in the Son, ſhould have life everlaſting,</hi> Joh. 6. 40. and ſaid the Jews to him in verſ. 28. <hi>What ſhall we do that we may work the works of God? Jeſus anſwered, This is the work of God, that ye beleeve on him whom he hath ſent,</hi> verſ. 29. The like Queſtion and Anſwer is in <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 30, 31. and therefore beleeving is commanded in the Law as the chief work, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 23. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 30. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 3. unto which we muſt give obedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 5. and there are no good works that can proceed from any that will be accepted of God for good works, but from thoſe that are <hi>created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works,</hi> Eph. 2. 10.</p>
                  <p>Thus far I have made it evident that <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 5. is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of ſuch a doing of the Law as belongs to the Covenant
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64895:37"/>
of grace, and therefore it is no proof that the moral Law of nature was the condition of the firſt Covenant.</p>
                  <p>But ſaith Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> in his fifth Propoſition in page 3. <hi>Adams obedience to the moral Law was by Gods free Covenant ordained to merit life by.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2 <hi>Reply.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> had proved as well, as affirmed, that God had ordained the moral Law by his free Covenant to merit life <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Adams</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the moral Law of nature, was con-natural to him, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was not ordained to merit life by.</note> by, then he had hit the nail upon the head; but his proofs hitherto have failed, and I beleeve it is paſt his skill to give any cleer proof of it.</p>
                  <p>True it is (ſaith Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> page 133.) that the promiſes run upon this condition, <hi>If ye obey my Voyce, and do my Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But (ſaith he) Conditions are of two ſorts,</p>
                  <p>Antecedent, or</p>
                  <p>Conſequent.</p>
                  <p>Antecedent, when the condition is the cauſe of the thing promiſed or given, as in all civill Contracts of juſtice, where one thing is given for another. (The like may be ſaid of the firſt Covenant made with <hi>Adam;</hi> God by way of free Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant did condition to confirm him in his created perfections, for one act of obedience, namely, in caſe he had but firſt eaten of the Tree of life: As I have ſhewed more at large in Sect. 1.)</p>
                  <p>2 There is a Conſequent condition, when the condition is annexed to the promiſe as a qualification in the ſubject, or an adjunct that muſt attend the thing promiſed; And in this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſenſe obedience to the Commandements was a condition to the promiſe, not the cauſe why the thing promiſed was vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed, but a qualification in the ſubject capable, or a conſequent of ſuch great mercy conferred.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I do further reply thus; That the doing in <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 5. is not the ſame for ſubſtance with the firſt Covenant of works (as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> affirms.)</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Becauſe it ſpeaks only of the manner of obedience in the Covenant of grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:64895:38"/>
2 It is not the ſame with the moral Law of nature in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of duties; for the moral Law of nature is not a compleat rule for duties to us, with out ſome ſupply from the Goſpel; for the Law of nature doth not command us to worſhip God in Chriſt, as the Decalogue doth; the moral Law of nature doth not command us to beleeve, to repent, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>and to yeeld ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to Chriſt, as the Decalogue doth (as Mr. <hi>Burges</hi> hath largely obſerved in <hi>Vindiciae legis)</hi> neither doth the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture forbid ſins againſt the Goſpel, as unbeleef, impenitency, and contempt of grace, as the Decalogue doth; neither doth the Law of nature command us to ſanctifie every ſeventh day, as the Decalogue doth: All theſe things are added by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace to the Decalogue, more then was in the moral Law of nature.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the <hi>Doing</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 5. is not the ſame for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with the firſt Covenant, neither in reſpect of juſtification, nor in reſpect of ſanctified walking.</p>

                     <p>From all theſe Premiſes it follows, that <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 5. is not meant of doing by way of merit; as doing the Command in eating of the Tree of life would have been a meritorious act according to Gods free grace in the firſt Covenant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the moral Law of nature, and the Decalogue (which comprehends the Covenant of grace) is not the ſame for ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>2 Hence it follows, that the doing of the moral Law by <hi>Adam,</hi> and the doing of it by Chriſt, was con-natural to them, and therefore it was not ordained as the inviolable rule of Gods Relative Juſtice for mans juſtification and life, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth propound it.</p>

                  <p>THis Scripture is alleged by Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> to prove that the moſt principal death there threatned (for the breach of the firſt Covenant of works) was eternal death in hell, and ſaith he, in his firſt Propoſition, <hi>Chriſt (as the Surety of the Elect) ſuffered the Eſſential puniſhment of this curſe in a way of obedient ſatisfaction unto divine Juſtice, thereby exactly fulfilling the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi> In his ſecond Propoſition, he ſaith, <hi>That God in the firſt Covenant proceeded with man in away of Juſtice.</hi> In his third Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition he calls it <hi>Relative Justice.</hi> In his ſixth Propoſition, he calls it, <hi>The Rule of Gods proceeding between God and man.</hi> In his eighth Propoſition, he ſaith, <hi>That God having conſtituted that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable rule of Relative Juſtice</hi> in Gen. 2. 17. <hi>could not avoid, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his power now limited, to proceed by this Rule,</hi> namely, firſt, <hi>According to the recompence contained in the promiſe in caſe of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi> or ſecondly, <hi>according to the puniſhment contained in the curſe in caſe of diſobedience.</hi>

                  <p>The true nature of this death, I make to be a ſpiritual death in ſin only.</p>
                  <p>This is evident by two Circumſtances in the Text.</p>

                     <item>1 By the adjunct of time; <hi>In the day,</hi> or at what time ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. <note place="margin">The death in Gen. 2. 17. is limited by two Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to our ſpiritual death in ſin only, and therefore that death is the eſſential curſe there threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and therefore 2. Chriſt was not a Surety with <hi>Adam</hi> in the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to bear that death that is there threatned.</note>
                     </item>
                     <item>2 By the Antitheſis of his death threatned, to the kind of life that was promiſed.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, No other death according to this adjunct of time was threatned to be formally executed, but a ſpiritual death in ſin only. And therefore firſt, no other death was properly threatned in this Text. And therefore ſecondly, it was a foul miſtake in <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to hold that bodily death only was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this Text, becauſe ſaid he, There was no day nor hour wherein our firſt Parents were not <hi>morti <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>bnoxii,</hi> ſubject to death.</p>
                  <p>But Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. Q. 21. doth thus anſwer him, The words of the Text, <hi>in Dying, thou ſhalt dye,</hi> ſeem to imply an actuall death, which they ſhould then ſuffer, and not a poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial only.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer further, that if a bodily death were there only meant, or chiefly meant, as others ſay, then where ſhall we find any other Text beſides this, wherein our ſpiritual death in ſin is threatned? ſurely there is no other Scripture that threatens our ſpiritual death in ſin, but this Text only, neither was ſpiritual death executed at any other time, but at this time only; It was but once threatned, nor but once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, and that was done in the day or time of <hi>Adams</hi> eating; therefore that death only is the death that is threatned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
                  <p>2 The true nature of this death may the better be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by conſidering the true nature of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin; whether it was a ſin againſt the moral Law, or againſt a poſitive Law only,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 I have already ſhewed, That it was not a ſin againſt the moral Law of nature; and therefore <hi>Adam</hi> was not under the obligation to puniſhment by that Law.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Neither was his ſin the ſin of a ſingle perſon, for then <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf only had been under the obligation to the puniſhment threatned.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Therefore it was a ſin againſt a ſupreme poſitive Law only made concerning outward things that were indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in their own nature; and I never heard that eternal death was ever directly threatned for the breach of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ny outward
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64895:39"/>
poſitive Law, but at firſt a ſpiritual death in ſin, and ever after a bodily death only; but yet for want of faith in Chriſt, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death will follow after a bodily death.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 It was a ſin againſt the good of mans nature in general, becauſe it was a ſin againſt that Covenant which God had made with <hi>Adam</hi> concerning the condition of mans nature, as he was the head of mans nature in general, as I have ſhewed in Sect. 1.</p>
                  <p>If his ſin had been a moral ſin only, then he had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to the puniſhment of the moral Law; but I never heard that the moral Law did oblige ſinners to the puniſhment of death in ſin, to make their nature in themſelves, and in their poſterity, more ſinful then it was by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin; for by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, all are alike ſinners (in the ſame degree) of originall ſin.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Gods Covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> was by ordaining a ſpecial poſitive Law, unto which he annexed a ſpecial poſitive puniſhment for the tranſgreſſion of that Law, which was a ſpiritual death in ſin affixed to the very time of ſinning; and for the breach of other poſitive Ceremonial Laws after this, a bodily death only is often expreſly threatned.</p>

were all <hi>Adams</hi> ſins propagated to poſterity, but only the firſt; between which, and his other ſins, there was this difference, That by the firſt, the goodneſſe of mans nature was loſt, And by the other, the goodneſſe of <hi>Adams</hi> grace was taken away.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Hence it follows, that ſeeing <hi>Adams</hi> ſin was not ſo much againſt his perſon, as it was againſt mans nature in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral (for it was againſt the Covenant that God made with him, touching mans nature in general, he being the head of mans nature) therefore the death threatned was ſuch a kind of death as was to be formally executed on mans nature in general at the very inſtant of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinning, and that was no other but a ſpiritual death in ſin only; and this death takes hold of all fleſh as ſoon as ever they have life in the womb, none excepted of them that are born by the ordinary way of generation; ſo then the puniſhment of death which God firſt threatned and inſlicted on <hi>Adams</hi> nature for his ſinfull act againſt the firſt Covenant, by eating of the forbidden fruit, was a ſpiritual death in ſin, which is now become nature to us, becauſe the Covenant being broken, the puniſhment muſt fall on ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yea Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> himſelf in page 116. doth exempt many from bodily death at the day of Judgement; Such as are alive (ſaith he) at the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall not formally dye by the ſeparation of their ſoul from their body; So then it follows by good conſequence, that neither a bodily death, nor eternal death in hell, was threatned to be formally executed on mans nature in general, at the inſtant of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinning, but a ſpiritual death in ſin onely.

                  <p n="2">2 This is alſo worthy of all due conſideration; That this bodily death was not threatned to be formally executed in the day of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinful eating, as death in ſin was.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Neither was a bodily death threatned to be formally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted on any certain day afterwards.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Neither did God ceaſe to threaten a bodily death, as he ceaſed to threaten a ſpiritual death, after this time; but upon the committing of ſuch and ſuch ſins, he did ſtill from time to time threaten, a bodily death: But after the firſt threatning of a ſpiritual death in ſin, God did never threaten that death any more; he did but once threaten that death, and but once exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 When God denounced the ſentence of a bodily death to beleeving <hi>Adam</hi> he adjudged him and all his beleeving poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity no further then their bodies to the earth, whence Chriſt ſhould one day raiſe them, and by that means utterly aboliſh from them all ſin and corruption; but he adjudged his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving ſeed; not only to a bodily, but alſo to an eternal death in hell.</p>

                  <p>And the matter is yet more plain by verſ. 14. <hi>Nevertheleſſe death reigned from</hi> Adam <hi>to</hi> Moſes, <hi>over them that had not ſinned after the ſimilitude of</hi> Adams <hi>trangreſsion;</hi> that is to ſay, Death reigned over Infants from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> for their original ſin, before ever they had ſinned actually after the ſimilitude of <hi>Adams</hi> Tranſgreſſion; and ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> in verſ. 21. <hi>Sin</hi> (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly original ſin) <hi>reigned unto death:</hi> Hence it follows, that the wages of <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſin was death in ſin, and the wages of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Many other Orthodox Writers do confirm this for a cleer truth, That God inflicted bodily death on mans nature in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral as a puniſhment of original ſin; now if it were inflicted on man as a puniſhment of original ſin, then it was not threatned as the immediate effect of <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſin in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17.</p>

                  <p>In theſe words we ſee that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> held that <hi>Adam</hi> firſt dyed to ſin according to <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. And ſecondly, to nature, long after his death in ſin.</p>

                  <p>Theſe conſiderations, I confeſſe, did amuſe me at the preſent, my conſcience, I bleſſe God, being tender of truth, and not being able to ſatisfie my ſelf at the preſent to the contrary, I durſt not oppoſe it, and therefore I did at that preſent manifeſt my ſelf to be convinced.</p>
                  <p>But ſince then, I bleſſe God, I find ſufficient light to ſatisfie me that my firſt Expoſition in the Dialogue was right: Though I confeſſe I have found it a point of great difficulty to find out the true nature of that death in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. and to diſtinguiſh it from bodily death; and I ſee that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth alſo make it a Query, Whether <hi>Adam</hi> caſt away Gods Image, or whether God took it away from him, in his <hi>Aphoriſmes,</hi> page 75. but in page 34. he ſeems to hold, that after <hi>Adam</hi> had eaten of the forbidden fruit, he dyed ſpiritually by being forſaken of God, in regard of holineſſe, as well as in regard of comfort; and ſo he was deprived of the chief part of Gods Image; but ſo was not Chriſt, ſaith he.</p>

                  <p>This of <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and ſundry others to the ſame purpoſe did much ſway with me; then alſo I conſidered that <hi>Adams</hi> perfections were created to be but mutable, untill he ſhould

take a courſe for the confirmation of them by eating of the Tree of life, and therefore they were but lent him for a triall; for in caſe he ſhould firſt eat of the Tree of knowledge of good and evill, he ſhould dye the death, and ſo loſe his created perfections; and therefore as ſoon as he had ſinned by eating that forbidden fruit, God in juſtice took them away.</p>
                  <p>But it hath pleaſed God by his free promiſe to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a debtor to the Elect, for the confirmation and continuance of their faith and grace, becauſe it was purchaſed for them by the blood of Chriſt to be of a laſting and permanent nature; but God made no ſuch promiſe to <hi>Adam</hi> when he created him after his own Image; for he created him to be but of a mutable condition, and therefore his graces were to be continued no otherwiſe but upon condition only of his obedience in eating of the Tree of life in the firſt place; ſo that when the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was broken on his part by eating the forbidden fruit, it was juſt with God to take away thoſe gifts and graces where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he had endowed his nature at firſt.</p>
                  <p>In like ſort at the firſt, God gave unto <hi>Saul</hi> the Spirit of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as a new qualification added to his former education, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 6. 9. But afterwards it pleaſed God to take away this Spirit of Government from him, becauſe he gave it no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe but upon condition that he ſhould uſe it for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his will and command; And had he continued to uſe it for that end and purpoſe, he ſhould ſtill have enjoyed it; but when he abuſed the ſame to the fulfilling of his own will in ſparing of <hi>Agag,</hi> then God took away this ſpirit of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from him, and then <hi>Saul</hi> grew wicked, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 14. And why might not God as well take away his created qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from <hi>Adams</hi> nature, for his diſobedience againſt his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive command, as well as from <hi>Saul</hi> for diſobedience to his poſitive command?</p>

                     <p n="3">3 Hence it follows, that the inviolable rule of Gods rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Juſtice for mans Redemption is not to be fetched from <hi>Gen. 2. 17.</hi> but from the voluntary cauſe of Gods ſecret will not yet revealed to <hi>Adam</hi> till after his fall; and that ſecret will (but now revealed) was that the formality of Chriſts death in ſeperating his ſoul from his body by his own Prieſtly power ſhould be a ſacrifice, and the formality of all ſatisfaction, as it is explained in <hi>Heb. 9. 15, 16.</hi> and <hi>Heb. 10.</hi>

pleaſe to ſee my Reply to his Expoſition of <hi>Gen. 2. 17.</hi> In Chap. 10. and in other places I have often Replied to <hi>Gen. 2. 17.</hi> as you may ſee by the Table to that Scripture.</p>
                     <p>But as touching Gods promiſes of ſalvation, and his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of damnation, there is not the ſame reaſon of Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming promiſes and threatnings, for mans happineſſe is contained in the promiſes, and therefore man performing the condition, God cannot but will the reward; the ſame will that wills the making of the promiſe muſt neceſſarily will the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the reward promiſed, the condition being performed, otherwiſe it would be vain, and of no uſe for God to make promiſes to man: But as for threatnings which concern mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, there is no ſuch tye upon God (unleſſe his threatnings be delivered with an oath) and therefore man will not, and cannot complain if they be not executed; and if God will rather glorifie his mercy in remitting the puniſhment, upon what account he thought beſt in the Counſel of his own Will, who can ſay he is unjuſt? mercy herein rejoyceth againſt judgement.

                        <hi>Reply.</hi> My former Expoſition of <hi>Gen. 2. 17.</hi> in Sect. 3. is a ſufficient confutation of this Propoſition; But Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> goes another way in his opening of that text, and of that threatning, and yet he doth not prove, but beg the queſtion, and then he makes his inferences: The Elect then having ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, muſt dye; he takes not this death for death in ſin, as the truth is, but he takes it principally for eternal death in hell: I ſay, in that ſenſe his Propoſition is not true; for God never willed that the Elect ſhould dye an eternal death; (in his fifth Propoſition, he ſaid, Gods will was the rule of his relative
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64895:46"/>
juſtice) and yet he willed that the Reprobate ſhould conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently dy an eternal death in the ſame threatning, in caſe they did not imbrace the mercy offered by the promiſed Seed. What God intended by that threatning is now evident to us by experience, namely, that the Reprobate ſhould dye a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual death in ſin, and after that a corporal, and after that an eternal death; and that the Elect ſhould dye a ſpiritual death in ſin as well as the Reprobate, and that after that they ſhould have a new nature by the promiſed Seed, and after that ſhould dye a corporal death, but yet that the Elect ſhould be freed from eternal death upon ſuch terms as were mutually agreed on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Trinity; and that the remains of their ſpiritual death, and alſo that their corporal death, and all other puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that ſhould be inflicted on them for ſin, ſhould by Gods Infinite mercy and wiſdome be turned to their good for the glorifying of his free grace and rich mercy.</p>
                     <p>And it was juſt with God to do according to this his wil, and therefore Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> concluſion of this Propoſition (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes his former part) as Gods will is the rule of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: So Gods will is the rule of the temperature of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The plain Engliſh of it muſt needs be this, That in as much as it was the will of God not to execute the threatning of eternal death ſtrictly upon the Elect, but to moderate it, and to ſuffer Sathan to inflict ſomething only contained in it upon their Mediator, by piercing him in the foot-ſoals at the ſame time when the ſeed of the Woman ſhould break his Head-plot, by making his ſoul a ſacrifice for ſin, as the price of their Redemption for the glory of his grace. This being the will of God, it muſt needs be juſt, as well as it was juſt for him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute all that was contained in the threatning upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1. IT ſeems that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> holds, That God had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained <note place="margin">Chriſts obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation and Death, was not moral obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the ſpecial Law of Mediatorſhip.</note> no other way to take ſatisfaction, but firſt by our Saviours performing of legal obedience for us, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eſſential puniſhment of hell torments, for this way only he calls, The way of Juſtice: But in the former Section, I have ſhewed that ſundry orthodox, whereof ſome of them do hold as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth, that Chriſt made ſatisfaction by ſuffering hell torments, as <hi>Pareus</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rutherfurd,</hi> and yet they deny that Chriſts obedience in his death was legal obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, contrary to Mr. <hi>Norton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2 I will adde Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> to them, for he held that Chriſt made <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ball</hi> on the Covenant, p. 281.</note> ſatisfaction by ſuffering the wrath of God (though in page 290. he ſeems not to hold that he ſuffered hell torments) and yet he alſo doth exempt the death of Chriſt from being any part of legal obedience. The Law (ſaith he) did not require that God ſhould dye, nor that any ſhould dye that had not ſinned, nor ſuch a death, and of ſuch efficacy, as not only to aboliſh death, but to bring in life by many degrees more excellent then that which <hi>Adam</hi> loſt.</p>
                  <p>And ſaith Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> Chriſt upon the Croſſe prayed for them <note place="margin">See <hi>Ball</hi> on the Covenant, p. 259.</note> that crucified him, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 34. But (ſaith he) that might be of private duty, as man, who ſubjected himſelf to the Law of God, which requires that we forgive our enemies, and pray for them that p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>te us; not of the proper office of a Mediator, which was to offer up himſelf a ſacrifice, who was to interecede for his people by ſuffering death. It behoved Chriſt as he ſubjected himſelf to the Law, to fulfill all Righteouſneſſe,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64895:50"/>
and to pray for his enemies, but that was not out of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per office as Mediator.</p>
                  <p>Hence the Reader may obſerve, that Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> makes Chriſts obedience to the moral Law to bee out of private duty, as a man, and not <hi>ex officio,</hi> out of the proper office of a Mediator, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth make all his legal obedience to be.</p>
                  <p>And ſaith he in page 287. Chriſt was Lord of his own life, and therefore had power to lay it down, and take it up. And this power he had (though he were in all points ſubject to the Law as we are) not ſolely by vertue of the hypoſtatical union (which did not exempt him from any obligations of the Law) but by vertue of a particular Command, Conſtitution, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to that ſervice of laying down his life. <hi>This Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement have I received of my Father,</hi> Joh. 10. 18.</p>
                  <p>3 Saith <hi>Baxter,</hi> The Law of the Creature, and the Law of <note place="margin">In Appendix to his Poſ. p. 128.</note> the Mediator are in ſeveral things different: The will of his Father which hee came to do, conſiſted in many things which were never required of us: And ſuch (ſaith he) are all the works that are proper to the office of Mediatorſhip.</p>
                  <p>4 Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> in his <hi>Elenchtick Animad.</hi> upon <hi>Gomarus,</hi> doth thus <note place="margin">Upon <hi>Gomarus</hi> p 25. Heb. 10. 10.</note> expound <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10. <hi>I come to do thy will;</hi> By which Will wee are ſanctified through the oblation of his body, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>That Will (ſaith he) is the Stipulation (or Covenant) of the Father about Chriſts undertaking our cauſe upon himſelf, and performing thoſe things that were requiſite for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of our ſins, therefore it comprehends all the obedience of Chriſt which he performed to the peculiar Law of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for this Law ſet apart, he was not bound by any other Law to the oblation of himſelf. And hence it follows, that if Chriſt made ſatisfaction by his obedience to another Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, then not by his obedience to the moral Law.</p>
                  <p>5 If God had commanded Chriſt to dye by the Juſtice of the moral Law, then his deſire, <hi>That the Cup might paſſe from him,</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 39. had been a ſinful deſire; But, ſaith Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> becauſe it was a poſitive Law only by which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to dye, therefore that deſire was no ſin, as I have noted his words more at large in Chap. 2. Sect. 1.</p>
                  <p>6 Saith Mr. <hi>Thomas Goodwin,</hi> The death of Chriſt was not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64895:50"/>
manded by the moral Law, but it was commanded over and beſides the moral Law, as I cited him in the former Section.</p>
                  <p>7 It ſeems that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> hath an art (beyond others) by which hee can make the miraculous work of Chriſts Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be moral obedience, or elſe he would never ſay, as hee <note place="margin">If the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Chriſt had been an act of obedience to the moral Law, then Chriſts God-head had been in an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute inferio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſupreme Command.</note> doth, That the Incarnation of Chriſt was an act of legal obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, in page 192.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arians</hi> will be much beholding to him for this Tenent; for if his Incarnation which was an act of his God-head, was an act of his obedience to the moral Law; then it follows, that the God-head of Chriſt was in an abſolute ſubjection, and ſo in an abſolute inferiority to his Father; for the moral Law is ſupreme compulſory Law given to inferiors.</p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> labours to prove, <hi>That the Incarnation of Chriſt was an act of legal obedience,</hi> in page 192. by <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. and in page 196. (ſaith he) <hi>Chriſt was ſubject to the Law not as man only, but as God-man Mediator,</hi> Gal. 4. 4, 5. And ſaith he in the ſame page, <hi>The Law whereto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Reply.</hi> His proof from <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. I will now examine, becauſe he doth cite it to prove that the moral Law was given to the Mediator, as the Law of his Mediatorſhip, as in page 103. 192, 196, 197, 200, 240, 267.</p>

                  <p>Any man that hath but half an eye, may ſee that the Apoſtle in this place ſpeaks only of the ceremonial Law (by which it appears that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> took but little heed to the Context) and therefore it is ſufficient to anſwer him in the words of Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> to the ſeventh Reaſon of <hi>Wigelin</hi> his 15. <hi>Theſis:</hi> This place to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> ſaith he, ſpeaks of the Law of Rites,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64895:51"/>
therefore it comes not here to bee handled (namely not in Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> ſenſe) for Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Law here whereunto Christ was made ſubject, is the Law whereunto wee are made ſubject.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> according to the Context, doth call it the Law of Rites, and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> doth Analyze the Text to that ſenſe onely; And ſo doth Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> on the Covenant, page 141, and 166.</p>
                  <p>But for the better clearing of this ſenſe, I will expound the ſeveral branches of <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4.</p>

But the Sacrifice of Chriſt (which was typified by theſe Rites being made in the fulneſſe of that time that was fore-appointed of the Father) had a true vertue and efficacie, by vertue of Gods Covenant with the Mediator to cleanſe the conſcience from the guilt of moral ſins, and to bring in a moral Righteouſneſſe, and ſo then the ceremonial

Righteouſneſſe muſt ceaſe; and thus the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> told <hi>Daniel,</hi> that the Meſſiah by his death ſhould make reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation for unrighteouſneſſe, and ſo bring in an Everlaſting Righteouſneſſe; and then ſaith the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> in verſ. 27. He ſhall confirm the Teſtament for the many, the laſt Seven, when in half that Seven, he ſhall end Sacrifice and Oblation; The words are thus opened by <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 26. But now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away ſin, <note place="margin">Heb 9 26.</note> namely to put away the Ceremonial uſe of Sin-offerings by the ſacrifice of himſelf; and in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. <hi>God ſending his own Son in</hi>

                     <hi>the likeneſſe of ſinful fleſh, and for his ſacrifice for ſin in the fleſh, Hee condemned ſin,</hi> that is to ſay, the uſe of Sin-offerings; becauſe his Sin-offering was of efficacy ſufficient to make an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Reconciliation, and Redemption, and to bring in an Everlaſting Purifying from ſin, which <hi>Daniel</hi> calls an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Righteouſneſſe. And thus in the fulneſſe of time, God ſent his Son to fulfill the Ceremonial Law of Types, and then it follows, that all Ceremonial Types muſt ceaſe, &amp;c. And thus Chriſt hath redeemed us for our moral ſins, and from the moral curſe; and this is worth the noting, that the Levitical Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are in Greek called <hi>Iuſtifications,</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 1. and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <note place="margin">Dan 8. 14.

3 <hi>Made of a woman;</hi> For according to <hi>Gen</hi> 3, 15. Hee was made of the ſeed of the woman, by the mighty power of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>Made under the Law:</hi> Being made of a woman, that was a Jew, he was made under the Law of Types.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>That he might redeem them that were under the Law:</hi> But hee could not redeem any from the boundage of <hi>Moſes</hi> Rites, untill hee had fulfilled all the Types, by his own bleſſed death and ſacrifice, in the fulneſſe of the time that was fore-appointed of the Father; and by that act he hath both redeemed us from the bondage of <hi>Moſes</hi> Rites, and alſo hath redeemed us mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally from the diſpleaſure of God, and from Sathans Head-plot.</p>
                  <p>It is true alſo that he fulfilled the moral Law as he was true man, and alſo that he fulfilled the preceptive part of <hi>Moſes</hi> Rites in his own practice, but that he did as he was a Jew only: but he fulfilled the Types as hee was a Mediator only, by his death and ſacrifice; and by that fulfilling he hath redeemed us, both from the bondage of <hi>Moſes</hi> Rites, and alſo from Sathans Head-plot.</p>
                  <p>And thus we may ſee, that the Types of the ceremonial Law, eſpecially thoſe Laws of Prieſts and Sacrifice, were ordained to <note place="margin">The ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Types of cleanſing, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of Prieſt and Sacrifice, did typifie our moral juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or cleanſing from all ſin by Chriſts Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in precu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Gods At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement.

                  <p>And ſecondly, hence it had vertue to confirm the Teſtament for the many, as it is expreſſed in verſ. 15, 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I had almoſt forgotten to parallel that ſpeech in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 27. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4, 5. which lyes thus.</p>
                  <p>He ſhall confirm the Teſtament for the Many, the laſt Seven, that is to ſay, in the very end of the laſt Seven, which is moſt preciſely called <hi>The fulneſſe of time,</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4 4.</p>
                  <p>Now where a Teſtament is confirmed, there muſt of neceſſity be the death of the Teſtator; for a Teſtament is confirmed, and of force, after men be dead, it is of no ſtrength at all whilſt the Teſtator lives, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>The next clauſe in <hi>Daniel,</hi> is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And in the balf of that Seven</hi> (which is three years and a half) namely in the end of this laſt half of the laſt Seven, which alſo is moſt preciſely called, <hi>The fulneſſe of time,</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>be ſhall end Sacrifice and oblation;</hi> and this ſpeech is directly parallel to that in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4, 5. <hi>He ſhall redeem them from under the Law;</hi> that is to ſay, by one and the ſame act of his Death and Sacrifice, he ſhall end Sacrifice and Oblation; and by that act he ſhall redeem us not only from the bondage of <hi>Moſes</hi> Ceremonies, but alſo from Sathans Head plot; or as it is in verſ. 24. By his death, <hi>He ſhall finiſh Treſpaſſe-offering, and end Sin-offerings, and ſo make reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for unrighteouſneſſe, and bring in an everlaſting Righteouſneſſe;</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:64895:53"/>
for he ſhall confirm unto us all the Legacies of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by his death, where the Spirit for regeneration, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſin for Juſtification, are the general Legacies.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I ſhewed (though not ſo compendiouſly as I could wiſh) that the word <hi>Law,</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. muſt bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the ceremonial Law only; And therefore firſt, All that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſaith touching Chriſts ſubjection to the moral Law, from <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. as the proper Law of his Mediatorſhip there intended, falls to the ground. And ſecondly, his charge of the ſecond Hereſie which he proveth from this Text, doth juſtly fall upon his own head; for this is certain, that if a Curſe be not juſtly given, it ſhal not come on the innocent, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26, 27. but it muſt return to the giver, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109. 17. Thirdly, Hence it follows, that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth again moſt groſly wrong this Text to prove that Chriſt ſuffered the curſe of hell torments in his death, in p. 103.</p>
                  <p>The laſt branch of Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> third Query is this:</p>

                     <p>He ſhould have proved, as well as affirmed, that God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of Chriſts legal obedience, as our obedience (then hee had ſhewed his skill) and then it had indeed been meritorious, and of ſuch value and ſufficiency; But becauſe hee doth but barely affirm it, therefore I ſhall paſſe it by without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examination here, becauſe I have ſhewed the contrary in the former Section, and alſo in Chap. 2.

                     <p>His fourth Query is a bare Affirmation.</p>

                        <item>2 Becauſe of the unchangeableneſſe of the condition which that degree of puniſhment doth incur.</item>
                        <item>3 Becauſe of the want of ſatisfaction.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now compare Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> at one time when he doth plainly lay down the grounds of Divinity, with Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> at another time when hee is pinched to anſwer <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Argument, and then you may finde him not well to accord with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Yea Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> himſelf gives another reaſon of the duration of Hell puniſhments, beſides inability to ſatisfie ſooner.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon (ſaith he) why eternal death is inflicted after the ſeparation of the ſoul from the body, is chiefly, becauſe this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily death puts a period to our capacity of having any part in the firſt Reſurrection, namely of Regeneration, whereby only the ſecond death is prevented, and I may alſo adde, whereby its eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is prevented. This reaſon which Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> hath here given, makes Eternity eſſential to Hell-torments. <note place="margin">The diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of eſſential and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torments, thereby to make Eternity no more but a circumſtance, hath four in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences attending it.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>This diſtinction of eſſential and circumſtantial Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torments, whereby hee labours to make Eternity to bee no more but a circumſtance, hath theſe four inconveniences at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 It ſuppoſeth that Divine juſtice in the execution of the legal curſe admits of a ſatisfaction, contrary to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 7, 8 9. <hi>Iob</hi> 36, 18, 19.</item>
                     <item>2 That Eternity of Hell-torments is not abſolute without ſome Ifs or Ands, but onely conditional, in caſe the damned cannot give ſatisfaction ſooner.</item>
                     <item>3 To ſay that Eternity is not an eſſential part of Hell, is to ſay that Hell may be Hell, and yet not be Eternal.</item>
                     <item>4 If this part of the curſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Eternity, may bee taken away from Hell-torments, then Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> may as well take away any other part from it.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:64895:55"/>
It is ſafeſt therefore (as I conceive) to ſay and hold, that eternity of puniſhment, flowing from the Curſe, is from the voluntary cauſe, or from the free conſtitution of Gods good pleaſure, as the due reward of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Sam. Hieron</hi> ſaith, That the extremity of Hell-torments are made known to us two wayes. <note place="margin">See <hi>Hicrons</hi> works p 294.</note>

                  <p>The Torments of Hell (ſaith <hi>Auſtin de Spiritu &amp; Anima lib.</hi> 3. c. 56. as I find him cited in <hi>Carliſle)</hi> are perpetual, terrible Terrors; fear without faith; pain without remiſſion; the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſtrangling, the Hell-hounds ſcourging, the worm gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the conſcience accuſing, and the fire conſuming, or rather continuing without mercy, end, relaxation, or eaſe.

                        <hi>The Eſſential Puniſhment of the Curſe</hi> (ſaith he in page 7.) <hi>is the total temporal privation of all the ſenſe of the good of the promiſe, called by ſome, The pain of Loſſe.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply</hi> 3. IN this point of the pain of Loſſe, Mr.<hi>Norton</hi> is like to loſe himſelf, for hee delivers himſelf variouſly, and contrariouſly, as may bee ſeen by comparing his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64895:56"/>
in this place, with his various expreſſions in other places.</p>
                  <p>In page 31. line 5. Hee calls it the privation of the preſent fruition of the good of the promiſe: Here the word <hi>ſenſe</hi> in <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> affirms that Chriſt ſuffered the pains of loſſe in reſpect of the frution of the good of the promiſe; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles he ſaith it was in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ſenſe of the good of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe by which wide differing expreſſions, he leaves the Reader in the dark to grope out his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. See Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> in Pſal. 21. cited alſo in Sect 4.</note> left out.</p>
                  <p>In page 68. Hee ſaith, That Chriſt had a taſte of conſolation at preſent in the Garden; But, ſaith he, his deſertion was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in reſpect of Senſe upon the Croſſe.</p>
                  <p>In page 111. (he ſaith) That the pain of Loſſe is the not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of ought of the good of the promiſes; and in page 112. he calls it The privation of the good of the promiſes. In both theſe places the word <hi>ſenſe</hi> is left out.</p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> delivers himſelf thus variouſly, it may juſtly ſtumble any judicious Reader how to underſtand him, whether hee bee to bee underſtood as leaving out the word <hi>ſenſe,</hi> or taking it in; for that word left out or taken in, doth much alter the ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>In page 118. Hee tells us in the Margin of <hi>Separatio quo ad ſubſtantiam,</hi> in reſpect of ſubſtance, <hi>&amp; quo ad ſenſum,</hi> in reſpect of ſenſe and feeling.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. ſaith, Wee are not to underſtand that the deſertion (of Chriſt) was real, but only in reſpect of ſenſe and feeling; and ſo muſt the privation of the good of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe bee underſtood; either that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth mean it is real, or in reſpect of ſenſe and feeling only.</p>
                  <p>The former is a total privation; the latter is only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.</p>
                  <p>The former is judgement without mercy, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
                  <p>The latter remembers mercy in judgement, though it may not be diſcerned at the preſent.</p>
                  <p>Now if Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> meaning bee, that Chriſt ſuffered ſuch a privation of the good of the promiſe as is real, namely as it is contra-diſtinguiſhed from privation in ſenſe and feeling, then the word <hi>ſenſe</hi> might well have been left out, becauſe it being put in, doth caſt a miſt before the eyes of the Reader.</p>
                  <p>But if he mean no more but ſuch a privation of the good of the promiſe, as conſiſts only in ſenſe and feeling, and as it is diſtinguiſhed from the ſaid real privation, then it is very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called a total privation, and then the pain of loſſe doth

contain much more in it than this; for a godly man may meet with as much as this in his life time, as <hi>Spira</hi> did, if wee ſuppoſe him to be godly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This Eſſential puniſhment</hi> (ſaith hee in page 8.) <hi>was that, and only that, which Chriſt ſuffered.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply</hi> 4. I cannot but wonder at his various delivery of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>For in his 5 <hi>Diſt.</hi> page 10. He ſaith, That Chriſt ſuffered the pains of Hell due to the Elect, who for their ſins deſerved to bee damned.</p>
                  <p>And in page 22. He makes it one branch of the death threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. to bee ſeparated from the ſenſe of the good <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 17.</note> things of the promiſe, and calls it total in Chriſt, and total in the Reprobates, and all this flowing from the ſame Curſe.</p>
                  <p>And in page 68. Hee calls it his total deſertion in reſpect of ſenſe upon the Croſſe; and preſently after he ſaith, The pain of loſſe, and the pain of ſenſe, make up the full meaſure of the eſſential wrath of God; and they both met together in full meaſure upon him on the Croſſe. Mark this, Hee doth in both theſe places hold, that Chriſt ſuffered the full meaſure of the pain of loſſe.</p>
                  <p>And in page 79. He ſaith, That forſaking is either total and <note place="margin">Pſal. 22. 1. Mat. 27. 46.</note> final; ſo God forſakes the Reprobate: or partial and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, as concerning the fruition and ſenſe of the good of the promiſe; ſo God forſook Chriſt. Of his forſaking, Chriſt complains in this place, being a principal part of that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which Chriſt (as the Surety of the Elect) was to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo.</p>
                  <p>And preſently after he ſaith, That Chriſt ſuffered the guilt and puniſhment of ſin; a chief part whereof was this Divine penal deſertion; and his following words do imply, that this was the curſe of the pain of Loſſe.</p>
                  <p>Mark, that in this place hee holds only a partial forſaking.</p>
                  <p>And in page 80. Hee ſaith, That Chriſt was forſaken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>nally, yet partially and temporally, not to any and finally. Here alſo hee doth hold no more but a partial forſaking, and denies total.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:64895:57"/>
And in page 118. Hee ſaith, Though the ſeparation of the damned from God, is total and final; yet the ſeparation or rather deſertion of Chriſt was partial and temporal, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ſenſe of the favour of God, and only for a time.</p>
                  <p>And ſaith he, There are two kinds of penal deſertion, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking; one is only in part for a time.</p>
                  <p>The other is total and final; ſo the Reprobates are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken in Hell.</p>
                  <p>And in page 122. Hee ſaith, That Chriſt was wholly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken in reſpect of any participation of the ſenſe of the good of the promiſe for a time, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 46. <note place="margin">Matth 27. 46.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in page 123. Hee ſaith, That God forſook him with a temporal and partial deſertion, and preſently after, The ſoul and body, being ſeparated from all participation of the good of the promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Here the word <hi>ſenſe</hi> is left out, and in the former place hee denieth that he had any ſenſe of the good of the promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Now let the Reader judge, whether hee can eaſily gather out of theſe various and uncertain expreſſions, what Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth diſtinctly affirm touching the pain of Loſſe, that Chriſt ſuffered; for one while, he calls it, Total ſeparation; another while he ſaith, It was partial; and then the fruition and ſenſe is put in alſo; one while hee doth limit his ſufferings to the ſenſe of the favour of God as in page 118. another while he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ſaith that hee was ſeparated from all participation of the good of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, in page 123. In this laſt ſpeech hee leaves out the word ſenſe, which implies the higheſt degree of ſuffering; for it takes <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> in p. 123 holds that Chriſt both in ſoul &amp; body was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In this 123. page Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth ſpeak out his meaning plain enough.</p>
                  <p>Namely that the ſoul and body of Chriſt was ſeparated from all participation of the good of the promiſe for the while; and ſo he comes up to a Total (though temporary) ſeparation from God, and more then a partial, which hee frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied in the places above cited, and comes up to a real ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64895:57"/>
which Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> (above cited) doth deny; and to <hi>ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio quo ad ſubſtantiam</hi> mentioned in page 118. (and not only <hi>quo ad ſenſum)</hi> which Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> denies (as he there cites him) and the plain words of the Scripture do alſo oppoſe him in <hi>Joh. 16. 32. I am not alone, the Father is with me.</hi> Now if the Father <note place="margin">Joh. 16. 32.</note> was preſent with him, then he had communion with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the while that his Diſciples did leave him alone; for that place doth tell us, that theſe words of Chriſt do refer to the whole time of his ſufferings while his Diſciples ſhould leave him alone; hee told his Diſciples that when the Shepherd was ſmitten, they ſhould bee ſcattered, <hi>Matth. 26. 31. Yea ſaid Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 16. 32. <hi>The hour is now come that yee ſhall bee ſcattered, and yee ſhall leave me alone, and yet I am not alone, becauſe the Father is with me,</hi> in reſpect of inward ſupport.</p>
                  <p>2 On the other hand, if Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> expreſſions do own that Chriſt ſuffered no more in the point of the pain of loſſe, <note place="margin">Sometimes Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> makes the pain of loſſe to be no more but the want of the ſenſe of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God for a time.</note> ſave only the ſenſe of the favour of God, and but only for a time as his expreſſions are in page 118. Then hee holds that Chriſt ſuffered no more in the point of the pain of loſſe, than many a child of God doth ſuffer in the work of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, who do notwithſtanding at the very ſame time par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the good things of the promiſe, as Regeneration, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, Juſtification, and Adoption: And then alſo, if Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> hold that Chriſt in his deſertion ſuffered no more than this, he doth croſſeſhins with his other Principle in p 123. That the execution of the evil of the Curſe denies communion (but not union) with God; but it is out of all controverſie that Chriſt had communion with God in other things, although Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> ſuppoſition were true, that hee was deprived of the ſenſe of his favour.</p>
                  <p>The Judicious Reader will ſoon perceive that the pain of loſſe in the eſſentials of it, muſt needs produce greater ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings then only the loſſe of the ſenſe of Gods favour for a time, and Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> himſelf doth acknowledge as much in page 113. The pain of loſſe (ſaith he) conſiſts not in the meer want of the favour or love of God; The Reprobates, whether men or devils, are alwayes hated of God, &amp;c. And ſecondly, ſaith Dr. <hi>Ames, Privation is the loſſe of an infinite good.</hi> And thirdly, Theſe Scriptures rightly expounded, will put more

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply</hi> 5. Ere while he ſaid that the pain of loſſe was onely the loſſe of the ſenſe of the favour of God for a time; if his ſufferings were no more then ſo, then it is evident, that God, in the courſe of his ordinary diſpenſation, doth ſuffer many of his children in this life to bee wholly bereft of the ſenſe of his favour for a time: Therefore in this caſe, what need is there that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſhould flye to Gods extraordinary diſpenſation, except hee think that the pain of ſenſe, over and above the pain of loſſe, could not bee ſuffered without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary diſpenſation?</p>
                  <p>According to Gods ordinary diſpenſation, hee grants that Chriſt could not ſuffer Hell-torments in this life: But (ſaith he) he ſuffered them by an extraordinary diſpenſation, and yet according to Gods ordinary diſpenſation the Saints have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the pains of <hi>Sheol.</hi>

                  <p>Now let the Reader judge what a refuge hee is forced to flye unto to ſupport his grand Maxim; and how far he yeelds the caſe unto the Dialogue, ſeeing hee cannot maintain what hee would maintain, but by Gods extraordinary diſpenſation.</p>
                  <p>It is a poor peece of Divinity to maintain that for the only truth, and to condemn the contrary for damnable Hereſie, and yet have no better proof to flye unto for the ſupport of it, than Gods extraordinary diſpenſation.</p>
                  <p>Out of all doubt Purgatory, and the Miracles that are in the legend of Saints may paſſe for current truth, if they may but flye to Gods extraordinary diſpenſation, without demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Scripture.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Accidental part of the puniſhment of the Curſe is all the reſt of the penall evill thereof, and befals the Reprobate, not from that Curſe ſimply, but from the diſpoſition of the Patient under that Curſe. Of theſe accidental parts of puniſhment (which if you pleaſe may well paſſe under the name of penal adjuncts) are final and total ſeparation from God, total and final deſpair, final death in ſin, duration of puniſhment for ever, the place of puniſhment, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply 1</hi> THe Reader may pleaſe to take notice that (except Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> intend more under this unlimited word <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> here is inſtanced only ſuch penal evils as are competible to a ſinner under damnation executed; But the precedent parts of puniſhment that flow upon ſinners from the curſe in this life the <note place="margin">Death in ſin is the eſſential Curſe in Gen. 2. 17.</note> doth not mention; and whether he hold any of them to be eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts of the curſe, or no, he hath not expreſſed his meaning; but in his vindication of <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. hee placeth death in ſin as wel as death for ſin within the compaſſe of the term Death, equally flowing from the curſe there mentioned; ſome particulars of that death in ſin may bee thus inſtanced; 1 The loſſe of Gods Image. 2 Corruption of nature. 3 Servitude under ſin, and Satan.</p>
                  <p>4 Gods puniſhing one ſin with another; Theſe and the like are <note place="margin">In mar. l. r. c. 12. Theſ. 45, 46, 47.</note> reckoned up by Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> and hee doth ſhew four wayes how they have the reſpect of puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Now if Chriſt bare all the eſſentials of the Curſe, then hee muſt bear this of death in ſin, as I have more at large opened the true ſenſe of <hi>Gen. 2. 17.</hi> in <hi>Chap. 2. Sect. 3.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But fear of manifeſt blaſphemy will deny that Chriſt bare this eſſential puniſhment of the Curſe, and thence it will alſo follow, that either Chriſt bare not all the eſſentials, or that death in ſin is not eſſential, though it flow eſſentially from the ſaid Curſe.</p>
                  <p>2 If Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> hold that the puniſhment of death in ſin which doth befall all mankind in this life, is not <hi>(de jure,</hi> by
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64895:59"/>
due deſert as it is a rule of relative juſtice) of its own nature an eſſential puniſhment flowing naturally and eſſentially from the ſaid curſe, but rather by accident; then let him ſhew how the ſaid death in ſin doth not proceed from that curſe ſimply, but only from the condition of the Patient under the curſe; but I beleeve it will trouble his patience to make a clear Anſwer to this.</p>
                  <p>In his firſt Argument; in page 10. Hee ſaith, this ſentence <hi>(In the day thou eatest thereof thou ſhalt dye the death)</hi> was univerſal, given to <hi>Adam</hi> as a publick perſon, and holds all his poſterity, <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 17.</note> whether Elect or Reprobate, in caſe of ſin, guilty of death; by death I ſuppoſe he means death in the latitude of it, according to his expoſition of <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. and there namely in page 20. he ſaith, that the death there ſpoken of is the wages of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 21. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. That is, all evill (the evill of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin excepted) in one word; therefore (ſaith he) equivalent to an univerſal comprehending all kinds of death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply</hi> 2. From hence the Reader may take notice of theſe two expreſſions, 1 That he makes that word Death, to comprehend all kind of death. 2 That the death there ſpoken of, is the wages of ſin.</p>
                  <p>To me this is a peece of ſtrange Divinity, that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſhould hold the wages of ſin to bee either eſſential (namely ſuch as flows from ſin as the proper wages thereof) or elſe ſuch as is accidental, namely ſuch as is not the proper wages and deſert of ſin, but as it proceeds from the condition or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Patient under the ſaid wages, and due deſert of ſin.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſtill proceeds to explain his firſt Diſtinction, in <hi>page</hi> 8. in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abſolute ſeparation, diſ-union, or diſ-covenanting with God, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of Reprobation, not of the eſſence of Puniſhment, becauſe the Elect, notwithſtanding the commination ſtood in full force againſt them, yet they continued elected, and in Covenant with Chriſt; The Elect were in Chriſt, before they were in</hi> Adam.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1. I Suppoſe Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> meaning is, That the Elect were in Chriſt virtually before they were in <hi>Adam</hi> actually. Hence I infer, that in the ſame ſenſe they were elected in Chriſt, they were elected to be partakers of Chriſt, and his Ranſome; if ſo, then I cannot ſee how the commination could ſtand in <note place="margin">Seeing the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect were in Chriſt virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, before they were in <hi>Adam</hi> actually it proves that eternal death did not ſtand in full force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, but a ſpiritual death only.</note> full force againſt them, ſeeing (according to that Election) they were by him redeemed from the curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. Enmity ſlain, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 16. no condemnation to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. and the hand-writing that was againſt them taken away, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
                  <p>2 I confeſſe I am at a loſſe to find out the force of Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> reaſon here given; But it may be it will the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, when it is drawn into the form of an Argument. And thus it may run.</p>
                  <p>If the Elect were in Chriſt before they were in <hi>Adam,</hi> and continued elected in Chriſt though the commination ſtood in full force againſt them: Then abſolute ſeparation, diſ-union, and diſ-covenanting with God, is a conſequent of Reprobation, not of the eſſence of Puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>But the Elect were in Chriſt before they were in <hi>Adam,</hi> and continued elected in Chriſt, though the commination ſtood in full force againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Therefore abſolute ſeparation, diſ-union, and diſ-covenanting with God, is a conſequent of Reprobation; But not of the eſſence of Puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe the Antecedent part of the firſt Propoſition were granted (though it cannot bee all granted) yet I cannot ſee
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64895:60"/>
ſtrength enough in it to make good the conſequence.</p>
                  <p>It is no good way of reaſoning to argue, what is eſſential, or not eſſential in the Curſe, from the event, namely from what <hi>de facto</hi> was executed, or not executed on the Elect, ſeeing betwixt them, and the Curſe, the Covenant of grace doth (and from eternity did) virtually interpoſe, by Chriſt and his Ranſome.</p>
                  <p>It is more proper to judge what <hi>de jure</hi> doth eſſentially flow from the curſe to ſuch as (being the proper ſubjects of the Curſe) remain under it, without any interpoſition of Chriſt, and his Ranſome by the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p>3 I propound this to conſideration, from a paſſage of Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> in page 117. <hi>Gods rejection</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as it is the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, not the cauſe of ſin; ſo it is alſo the Antecedent, and not the cauſe of condemnation: Reprobation</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is an act of abſolute Lordſhip and Sovereignty, not of Iuſtice; Condemnation (that is, the judicial ſentencing to puniſhment for ſin) is an act of Iuſtice, not of Lordſhip; no Reprobate ſuffers the ſmart of his finger, becauſe a Reprobate, but becauſe a ſinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here I might by way of Parentheſis inſert this Query; Was <hi>Adam</hi> rejected? and was that the Antecedent to <hi>Adams</hi> ſin? And were not all mankind once in Covenant with God in <hi>Adams</hi> innocency?</p>
                  <p>4. I ſay, that abſolute ſeparation, diſ-union, or diſ-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting with God, is a part of that condemnation and judicial ſentencing unto puniſhment for ſin, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 41. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 23. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 9.

                  <p>5 If total and abſolute ſeparation and diſ-union with God, &amp;c. be a conſequent only of Reprobation, then it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds only from Gods Lordſhip and Sovereignty (as Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> words ſpeak) but in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 12. it proceeds from juſtice. The dead were judged according to their works, not according to Gods Lordſhip, nor Reprobation.

                  <p>6 The ſame thing may be both a conſequent of Reprobation, and a proper effect of juſtice, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> himſelf alſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth in page 111. <hi>The legal diſ-covenanting</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64895:60"/>
probate for their ſin which they have committed, is the effect of juſtice; that being diſ-covenanted they fall into the bottomleſſe pit, is alſo an effect of juſtice, but totality and finality of their diſ-union with God without recovery by the Covenant of Grace, is a conſequent of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And why may it not bee as truly ſaid, That the legal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covenanting of the Reprobates, and their falling into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit, are conſequents of reprobation, as ſay, that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and finality of diſ-union with God is a conſequent of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation? they are alike conſequents of reprobation, not proper effects of it, but rather effects of ſin intervening, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently proper effects of Vindicative juſtice.</p>

                  <p>But Mr.<hi>Norton</hi> doth ſtill explain his firſt Diſtinction, in theſe words, in page 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sin is not of the Eſſence of Puniſhment, becauſe Eſſential puniſhment is a ſatisfaction unto Iuſtice for injury done; but ſin is a continuing of the injury, and a provocation of, not a ſatisfaction unto juſtice.</hi>

                  <p>2 Saith he, <hi>Eſſential puniſhment is an effect of juſtice, of which God is the Author; But it is blaſphemy to ſay that God the Author of ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3 Saith he, <hi>The Elect ſuffer no part of penal puniſhment, yet are left unto ſin (for a time)</hi> This in the Parentheſis was in his Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript.</p>
                  <p>4 Saith he, in page 118. <hi>The ſinful qualities of the damned proceed not from Hell-torments as an effect from the cauſe. The torments of Hell are an effect and execution of juſtice, whereof God is the Author; Sinful qualities are a defect, not an effect, therefore they have a defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, not an efficient cauſe, therefore of them God cannot be the Author.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5 Saith he in page 118. <hi>Chriſt ſuffered the Eſſential puniſhment, but was without ſin.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <p>MR. <hi>Norton</hi> ſaith, <hi>That ſin is not of the Eſſence of puniſhment, becauſe ſin is not a ſatisfaction to juſtice (but rather a provocation of it) for injury done.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply</hi> 1. But ſaith Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> Puniſhment is an evil inflicted on the ſinner for ſin, In his Marrow <hi>l. 1. c. 12. n.</hi> 10, 11. This is a more proper definition of puniſhment than Mr. <hi>Nortons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Original ſin, as it was from Gods juſtice, was an evill inflicted <note place="margin">Death in ſin is an evil inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God as the eſſential puniſhment of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and was a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to juſtice, till it pleaſed God to make an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by the Covenant of Grace.</note> of God on mans nature in general, as a ſatisfaction to juſtice, and ſo it was a vindicative puniſhment, till Chriſt was revealed; to difference the Elect from the Reprobate by the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Sect. 1.

                     <p>2 Beſides the puniſhment of original ſin, God doth often puniſh mens perſonal ſins with ſin, which in ſome ſort may alſo be ſaid to bee a ſatisfaction unto juſtice; But as that ſin doth proceed from mans diſobedience to Gods Command, ſo it is a new and further provocation.</p>

And Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> himſelf ſaith thus in page 118. in that Propoſition, <hi>God puniſheth ſin with ſin; the futurition of ſin is to be diſtinguiſhed from ſin it ſelf: The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible and penal futurition of ſin is an effect of juſtice.</hi>

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 5. Chriſts ſufferings do all ariſe from the voluntary cauſe, and not from natural cauſes as ours do, namely from a voluntary poſitive Law, and not from the moral Law. But whether Chriſt ſuffered the eſſential puniſhment or no, is the great buſineſſe of this diſpute. The Dialogue denies it all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; let the judicious Reader judge whether this be fair diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to bring in ſuch a Propoſition as is in controverſie (and which hee knows before-hand will be denied) as a reaſon to confirm another doubtful point, this is no better than a begging of the Queſtion.</p>
                     <p>And now I leave it to the judicious Reader to judge whether his five Reaſons have weight ſufficient in them, to prove, that ſin as it is vindicative from God, flows not from the curſe Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; and his own words on <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. which I have cited in my

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> makes this point of duration to bee an adjunct only to Hell-torments, by a compariſon taken from the ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the debtor to pay, and therefore hee continues in priſon.

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 1. Any man may ſee that in this Anſwer he doth plainly contradict and confute his firſt principal Propoſition, and alſo his Aſſertion in his firſt Diſtinction; for in this and in other places alſo, he doth affirm, That Chriſt ſuffered the eſſential puniſhment of the curſe, and in pag. 123. he ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt both in Soul and Body was ſeparated from all participation of the good of the promiſe for a time;</hi> but in his Anſwer he dares not venture to ſay, that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the torments of hell in his body in kind, as he did in his ſoul; But inſtead of making a clear Anſwer to my Quere, he propounds another Quere, <hi>Who can deny,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered alſo bodily torments equivalent to the torments of hell?</hi> His firſt ground-work was, that Chriſt ſuffered in a way of exact ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice

                     <p>2 He croſſeth his firſt ground-work in page 121. <hi>It is ſufficient,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to integrate, and make up the execution of the full meaſure of wrath upon Chriſt, that if his bodily torments were not equal to the bodily torments of the damned, yet what was not executed on his body, was made up in his ſoul.</hi>

He that hath but half an eye may ſee that in this Anſwer, he doth fully overthrow his firſt fundamental Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his firſt Diſtinction, for in thoſe places he hath affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Chriſt ſuffered the very Eſſential Torments of Hell, in kind; but now he ſaith it is ſufficient to integrate, and make up the full execution of the full meaſure of wrath, that what was not executed on his body, was made up in his ſoul; firſt, hee confeſſeth that Chriſt did not ſuffer the full eſſential Curſe in his body, and then by ſome Revelation he knows that what was not executed on his body was made up in his ſoul; beleeve him that liſt, and yet he croſſeth this alſo in page 123<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for there hee ſaith, That Chriſt both in ſoul and body, was ſeparated from all participation of the good of the promiſe for a time; And thus he makes the eternal Curſe in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. one while to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in kind only, and another while to be arbitrary, and to bee ſuffered either in kind, or elſe in that which is equivalent; hee allows a leſſe puniſhment to his body, and ſo much more to his ſoul; doubtleſs he muſt know this by ſome private Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for he cannot find any Scripture that is rightly interpreted that will own it.</p>

                     <p>And in page 122. (he ſaith according to his fundamental Propoſition) <hi>That Chriſt was tormented without any forgiveneſſe, God ſpared him nothing of the due debt.</hi>

                     <p>And in page 122. Hee ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt had not ſo much as the leaſt drop of water to eaſe him in the leaſt particle of his ſuffering that was due to him according to juſtice, but was wholly forſaken in reſpect of any participation of the ſenſe of the good of the promiſe for a time.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 5. This he doth alſo plainly croſſe, for in page 68. hee doth acknowledge that Chriſt had a taſte of conſolation in the time of his Agony in the Garden, ſo that hee doth ſometimes give Chriſt a taſte of conſolation under his Eſſential Torments, and ſometimes not a drop of conſolation; either he muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that Chriſt was not yet under the eſſential puniſhment of the Curſe in the Garden, or elſe he muſt confeſſe that his Poſition in page 122. is not true; But he doth affirm, That Chriſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the eſſential Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſaith he, The true reaſon thereof is, Chriſt dyed as a ſinner imputatively, preſſed under the ſenſe of the wrath of God, and conflicting with eternal death. And in page 121. Chriſt ſuffered the Torments of Hell upon the Croſſe, where he bare the moral Curſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. and in the Garden.</p>

Hence it follows, that by theſe two laſt places he doth juſtifie his former Poſition in page 122. but ſtill that is contradictory which I cited in page 68. And thus Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth confute and contradict himſelf; and being uncertain in his principles, he leaves the truth of Chriſts ſatisfaction uncertain to a ſcrutinous conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Samuel Heiron</hi> ſaith in page 244. That the extremity of Hell-torments is made known to us two wayes.</p>

                     </list>
                     <p n="1">1 Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth croſſe both theſe Poſitions; For firſt, hee allows ſome eaſe to the body of Chriſt, though he ſaith, It was made up in his ſoul. And ſecondly, Hee had alſo ſome drop of conſolation to his ſoul in the Garden.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Hee alſo grants an intermiſſion after Hell-torments were begun upon Chriſt; for in page 68. Chriſt, ſaith he, had his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terims of reſpite, and in the Garden an interval of conſolation, otherwiſe, ſaith hee, Hee could not have fulfilled that which is written of him. But if this reaſon bee ſound and good, why hee had an interval of conſolation in the Garden, then by the ſame reaſon he muſt have an interval of conſolation on the Croſſe; for when he was in his greateſt Torments on the Croſſe, and ready to give up his ſoul, then he remembred that ſomething muſt be fulfilled that was written of him, for ſo doth <hi>John</hi> tell us, <hi>Joh. 19. 28.

                        <hi>thirſt?</hi> the anſwer is, becauſe he remembred that that Scripture in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 69. 21. muſt be fulfilled, and therfore he ſaid, <hi>I thirſt. When Jeſus therfore had received the vinegar</hi> (for the fulfilling of that Propheſie) <hi>he ſaid, It is finiſhed, and hee bowed his head, and gave up the ghoſt:</hi> Therefore no extremity of Torments did confound his memory <note place="margin">Joh. 19. 30.</note> and will, from fulfilling of what ever was written; but though Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth allow ſome interims of reſpite to Chriſt in the Garden, yet otherwhiles he ſaith, That Chriſt (whiles he was in the Garden) began not meerly to be amazed, but alſo to bee very heavy. The word (ſaith he) notes Expavefaction, which was ſuch a motion of his mind, ſuperadded to his conſternation, whereby for the time hee was diſ-inabled as concerning the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64895:65"/>
minding of any thing elſe, being wholly taken up with the dreadful ſenſe of the righteous wrath of God; he muſt have a better head then I, that can reconcile his former ſpeech, and this latter ſpeech together; before he ſaid, that Chriſt had his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rims of reſpite in the Garden, and an interval of conſolation, or <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> imputes the ſin of unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to Chriſt in time of executing his office.</note> elſe he could not have minded the fulfilling of that which was written of him; but now he ſaith, that in the Garden, he was in ſuch a motion in his mind, whereby for the time he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inabled as concerning the minding of any thing elſe; It is ſtrange that hee ſhould not be able to mind any thing elſe; and yet in his greateſt torments on the Croſſe, wee ſee, he was able to mind that one Scripture to be fulfilled, therefore hee ſaid, <hi>I thirſt:</hi> Therefore I conclude that this interpretation of Chriſts fear and heavineſſe in the Garden, by amazement, and by ſuch a motion of his mind as diſ-inabled him from the minding of any thing elſe but the ſenſe of the dreadful wrath of God, is a moſt dangerous imputation of ſin to Chriſt in the time of the execution of his Prieſtly Office, as I have noted it in Mar. 1433. in Chap. 17. Sect. 4. And though Dr. <hi>Williams</hi> doth hold that Chriſt ſuffered both the pain of Loſſe, and the pain of Sence, in page 437. yet in page 447. hee ſaith, <note place="margin">In his ſeven golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, p. 437. 4. 17.</note> That all the Divine comforts were not detained from him on the Croſſe, when he ſaid, <hi>My God, My God, Why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi>
                     </p>

If a Debtor (ſaith he) bring me what he ows me, it diſchargeth him preſently; But the payment of a Surety is a payment that is refuſable in itſelf, and therfore it effects not the diſcharge of the principal Debtor, but at the time, and according to the conditions between the Surety and the Creditor, and that time agreed on, was not till thoſe that live to yeers of diſcretion have actual faith.</p>

                  <hi>Reply</hi> 1. THough it bee granted that the Hitted of God ſignifies Reprobation, yet there is alſo a Hatred of God that reacheth unto Eternity.</p>
               <p>This cannot be Reprobation, for theſe two Reaſons. <note place="margin">The eſſential Torments of Hell is from Gods hatred to affirm there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Chriſt ſuffered the eſſential Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell, is to affirm that Chriſt ſuffered from Gods hatred.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 The hatred of Reprobation, ſaith Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> in his <hi>Marrow l. 1. c. 25. n. 38.</hi> doth only deny good, but doth not inflict evill, ſave only by the deſert of the creature coming between.</p>
               <p>This hatred of God doth inflict the evill of the curſe upon the damned, Therefore it is a hatred that is diſtinct from that of Reprobation.</p>
               <p n="2">2 This hatred is Eternal; for though Reprobation bee from Eternity in God, yet it is not Eternal; and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the end of Gods Reprobation is the manifeſtation of his juſtice, <hi>Rom. 9. 22.</hi> and when Gods juſtice is manifeſted, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64895:67"/>
the Curſe executed; then the end is obtained, and ſo Reprobation ceaſeth. See Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> in <hi>Marrow l. 1. c. 25. Theſ. 32.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply</hi> 2. In propriety of ſpeech, God is without all paſſions of anger, wrath, hatred, &amp;c. theſe things are aſcribed to God after the manner of men, when God doth that which doth make us think him to be angry, and to hate, becauſe we do ſo when wee are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and when we do hate.</p>
               <p>Hence it follows, that ſeeing Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> holds that God did execute the Eſſential puniſhment of Hell-torments upon Chriſt, as they are due to Reprobates, that God muſt do it in hatred to him, as well as to the Reprobates; and ſo the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors in Chap. 15. expound the term Second death (from whom it is taken) to bee a perpetual miſery in the hatred of God; And ſo ſaith Mr. <hi>Rutherſurd</hi> in Chriſts dying, page 35. 39. The Hell of the Reprobates is a ſatisfactory pain, and 2 It floweth from the hatred of God.</p>
               <p>But ſaith Mr. <hi>Norton, Though God did execute the Eſſentials upon Chriſt, yet in no ſenſe could be be ſaid ever to hate Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how can it be avoided? perhaps Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> will ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God did not execute the accidental and circumſtantial parts of the Curſe upon Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But may it not be more truly ſaid, becauſe Chriſt did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Eſſentials? Let the unpartial Reader judge between us.</p>

               <p>Lo! in this ſhort ſentence, how he doth connex guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment inſeparably to <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſin; he makes his guilt to be the proper paſſion of his firſt ſin. And hence it follows neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, according to Mr. <hi>Norton.</hi> That the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin being imputed to Chriſt, he muſt be ſpiritually dead in ſin, for ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual death in ſin is the proper guilt, and proper paſſion of <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſin. This I hinted at in the Dialogue. And of this ſee more in Chap. 2. in R. 2. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If original ſin had not been ordained in Gods juſtice to bee the proper guilt and puniſhment of <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſin, then it would follow that <hi>Adams</hi> eating of the forbidden fruit had been no ſin: And now compare Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> diſtinction to the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, Imputation of guilt (ſaith he) is the obligation to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: By this Doctrine it follows, that Chriſt did ſuffer the guilt and puniſhment of <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſin, namely, a ſpiritual death in ſin.</p>
               <p>Truly it makes my heart tremble at this inference; God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <note place="margin">God imputes the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſin to all men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind were true ſinners in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> by vertue of Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in general.</note> imputes the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſin to all the natural poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe Gods Covenant was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and the nature of all mankind in general, as I have ſhewed in Chap. 2.

               <p>Secondly touching the point of Gods imputation, I beleeve it cannot be ſhewed out of the Scripture, that God doth impute either guilt or any other thing to any perſon, unleſs the thing imputed have firſt a real exiſtence in the ſubject; as for example, God did not impute ſaith to <hi>Abraham</hi> for righteouſneſs, until faith had a real exiſtence in him, as the ſubject, and the like muſt be ſaid of any thing elſe that God imputes, therefore if God imputed the guilt of our ſins to Chriſt, then it follows that he was indeed guilty of ſin</p>
               <p>So that by Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> unadviſed collections, either Chriſt was a true inherent ſinner, or elſe the Father was a true ſinner in making a falſe imputation; I wiſh that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> may finde ſound light from the Scriptures to get himſelf fairly out of this dilemma.

In his appendix to juſtif p. 143</note> beſides, the threatning to be ſuffered is plainly directed to the ſinner himſelf in perſon; and therefore Chriſt was not in that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation; and therefore alſo Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> Court-language of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of guilt to Chriſt, as to our legal Surety, is no Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>language, it is but human language.</p>
               <p>By reaſon of the obligation upon us (ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter)</hi> we our ſelves were bound to undergo the puniſhment; therefore (ſaith he) Chriſts puniſhment was not in the obligation, but onely ours, and ſo the Law was not fully executed but relaxed; and whereas the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, ſaith he, is called a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous acceptation, a gracious imputation, &amp;c. How can any man (ſaith he) call it ſo, if it were the ſame thing that the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that Chriſt paid; to pay all according to the full exaction of the obligation, needeth no favour to procure acceptance.</p>
               <p>This very acknowledgement that Chriſts ſatisfaction was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of grace, doth clearly intimate, that Chriſt was not in the ſame obligation with <hi>Adam,</hi> or elſe it had been no favour to accept it of him.</p>
               <p>The Father (ſaith Mr. <hi>Blake)</hi> might have refuſed his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from the hand of Chriſt, and might have exacted it of the <note place="margin">See <hi>Blake</hi> on the Covenant, p. 18.</note> principal, and Chriſt alſo might have refuſed to make ſuch pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe he was not in the obligation; Theſe Reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and divers others, do plainly ſee and acknowledge, that Chriſt was not our Surety in the ſame obligation with <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> hath found out one clear Scripture,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64895:70"/>
namely, <hi>Lev.</hi> 17. 4. to prove that God doth impute ſin properly to the offender; ſo if he could have ſound out another Scripture as clear, to prove, that God doth impute guilt to one that is no ſinner, then he had hit the nayl upon the head; But as for that place he brings of <hi>Philemon,</hi> ver. 18. ſaying, <hi>So might</hi> Philemon <note place="margin">Phil. v. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>put</hi> Oneſimus <hi>debt upon</hi> Paul, it is not to the purpoſe, becauſe it is but an inſtance of a civil imputation (not divine) from the meer voluntary cauſe in <hi>Paul,</hi> and not from the revenging juſtice of <hi>Pbilemon;</hi> of which voluntary offer much queſtion might be made in a Court of Juſtice, how far <hi>Paul</hi> was obliged to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> whether any corpora puniſhment in kind, or whether a great ſum of money (ſeeing <hi>Paul</hi> had a good warrant from Gods Law to moderate in this caſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 15.) Suppoſe that <hi>Philemon</hi> had demanded of <hi>Paul</hi> a thouſand pound damage, would <hi>Philemons</hi> imputing this debt of a thouſand pound to <hi>Paul</hi> in the behalf of the wrong done by <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a juſt debt in a Court of Juſtice? who is able to cleer the intricacies of this inſtance? I beleeve this is no cleer inſtance for a Court of Juſtice to proceed by in ſuch like caſes, much leſſe is it fit for the preſent diſpute; For our diſpute is about Gods imputing ſin and guilt to man, or to the Mediator on mans behalf, and not about one mans imputing to another, which is but humane and civil.</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> had given but one Scripture-inſtance of a divine Imputation in the ſenſe hee pleads for, hee had a fair opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to have done it, when he cited the other two places.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing hee hath not done it, neither there, nor any where elſe, I beleeve he is not able to do it; and therefore for him to build ſo great weight upon this of <hi>Philemon,</hi> to prove that Chriſt was our guilty Surety, on whom. God did juſtly inflict the Eſſential Torments of Hell, is to run himſelf, and his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, into a labyrinth of confuſed error.</p>
               <p>That Preacher therefore ſaith <hi>Tindal,</hi> page 170. that bringeth a naked ſimilitude to prove that which is contained in no text of Scripture, nor followed of a Text, count a Deceiver, a Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der out of the way, and a falſe Prophet, and beware of his Philoſophy and perſwaſions of mans wiſdome, as <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. ſaith, &amp;c. for the reaſons and ſimilitudes of mans wiſdome, make no faith, but wavering and uncertain opinions only; one
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64895:71"/>
inſtance of a divine imputation of ſin to an innocent had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the point, but a hundred ſuch inſtances, of <hi>Philemons</hi> imputing of <hi>Oneſimus</hi> debt to <hi>Paul,</hi> is nothing to the point.</p>
               <p>If (ſaith Mr. <hi>Wotton)</hi> we take ſin formally, then I deny that our ſins were ſo imputed to Chriſt. His words at large I have recorded in my examination of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21.</p>
               <p>3 As for that Imputation by way of grace uſed ten times in <hi>Rom.</hi> the fourth,</p>
               <p>I cannot but wonder at the citing of this Text to explicate that manner of Gods imputing our ſins to Chriſt: ſurely <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. can have no reſpect of agreement to the Argument in hand; Therefore it is only cited to prove that the word impute is uſed in Scripture, as if any one that reads the Scripture were ignorant of it: but if any pleaſe to ſee the ſenſe of the word Impute in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. let them read Mr. <hi>Wotton de Reconc. peccatoris part. 2. l. 1. c.</hi> 15. <note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note>

                  <hi>It is certain, that Chriſt was couched and comprehended in ſome part of the revealed will of God, during the firſt Covenant: It is very probable</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>That the Tree of Life was a figure of Chriſt; And</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>If Chriſt be be not within the compaſſe of the Text, the Text is not true; And</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Elect ſinners, not dying in their own perſons, muſt dye in their Surety, or elſe the Text ſhould not be a truth.</hi>

But this kind of voluntary Sarety, doth differ as much from Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> bounden Surety in the ſame Obligation with <hi>Adam,</hi> as a free Redeemer doth differ from a bounden Surety.</p>
               <p>I grant therefore, that Chriſt was our Surety, as he was our free Mediator and Redeemer, but no otherwiſe; and ſo in an unproper ſenſe he may be called our Surety, but not in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per legal ſenſe, according to Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> Court-language.</p>
               <p>This way of ſatisfaction, firſt declared in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. is the foundation upon which all after Prophecies touching ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction by Chriſts death and ſufferings muſt have dependence; and as it was firſt exemplified to <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſacrifice of a Lamb, as I have ſhewed in the Inſtitution of the Sabbath, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all thoſe poſitive Laws touching Prieſt and Sacrifice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared afterwards to <hi>Moſes,</hi> are but the further opening of the manner of Chriſts ſatisfaction, and indeed thoſe types were but the Picture of what was agreed on in the Eternal Covenant to bee performed in due time by the ſeed of the Woman.</p>

               <p n="5">5 It was ordained in the Eternal Decree and Covenant, that Chriſt ſhould be conſecrated to his Prieſtly office (for the better making his death a ſacrifice) by afflictions, <hi>Heb. 2. 10.

God ordained all Chriſts greateſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings in his Paſſion to be for his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration to his ſacrifice.</note>
               </p>
               <p>To conſecrate, is interpreted by the Seventy, to make perfect: As for example, when the people had worſhipped the Golden Calf, <hi>Moſes,</hi> by Gods ſpecial poſitive command in <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 27. 29. commanded the Levites to conſecrate their hands, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfect and exact juſtice upon the Idolaters, without reſpect of perſons, not ſparing their own ſons, or neer kindred; and this act of theirs is recorded to their praiſe in <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 9. and by this impartial act of perfect juſtice their hands were conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God.</p>
               <p>2 The conſecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons to the Prieſtly office, was to bee effected by continuing ſeven dayes under the obſervation of certain particular Rites before their conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could bee finiſhed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 9. and <hi>Lev.</hi> 8. 22. and then
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64895:73"/>
the very next day after, their conſecration was finiſhed, <hi>Moſes</hi> bid them draw near to the Altar to execute the Prieſts office, by offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a ſacrifice, both for themſelves, and for the people, <hi>Lev.</hi> 9. 7. But Chriſt needed not to offer any ſacrifice for himſelf, and therefore it was only for his people.</p>
               <p>3 As <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to conſecrate <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons through many particular Rites exactly obſerved, whereof one was no ſmall affliction (though willingly born by them at the Lords appointment) namely, <hi>Yee ſhall abide at the door of the Tent of the Congregation day and night, ſeven dayes, and ſhall keep the charge of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

This exact watch, for that ſpace of time being ſeparated from their wives and families, under the penalty of death, was doubtleſſe a time of affliction to them, though, as I ſaid before, willingly born at the Lords appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>4 It is ſaid in <hi>Heb. 2. 10. It became him,</hi> namely, it became God the Father, <hi>that hee ſhould conſecrate the Prince of our ſalvation through afflictions.</hi> And it is alſo ſaid in verſe 17. <hi>That it behoved Christ to bee made like unto his brethren, that he might bee a merciful and a faithful high Sacrificer in things concerning God, and that hee might make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for the ſins of the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5 In theſe two verſes we may obſerve the execution of ſome of the Articles of the Eternal Covenant touching Chriſts Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, both on the Fathers part, and on Chriſts part.</p>
               <p n="1">1 It is ſaid of the Father, <hi>That it be came him to conſecrate the Prince of our ſalvation through afflictions;</hi> that is, to make his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience perfect through afflictions; or elſe if the Devil had not had full liberty to try his obedience by afflictions, hee would have objected thus againſt Chriſt; In caſe I might have had full liberty to try his obedience, as I had to try <hi>Adams</hi> obedience, this ſeed of the Woman would have been diſobedient to God, as <hi>Adam</hi> was; Therefore it became ſo perfect a Work-man as God was, to declare that Sathan had full liberty to enter the Liſts with the ſeed of the Woman, and to do his worſt to pervert his obedience, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, <hi>It behoved Chriſt, to be made like unto his brethren,</hi> and to enter the Liſts with Sathan, not in his divine nature, but in our nature, and to be touched with the feeling of our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and therefore it is alſo ſaid, <hi>That it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer,</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:64895:74"/>
Luke 24. 46. according to the Decree and Covenant declared in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. that ſo his obedience being made perfect, he might bee fully conſecrated to the execution of his Prieſtly office in making his Soul an acceptable Sacrifice to make Reconciliation for the ſins of Gods people, and thus hee became obedient to the death, <hi>Phi.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
               <p>And thus it became God to conſecrate, and Chriſt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated through afflictions, and therefore preſently after the Fall, God ſaid to Sathan, Thou ſhalt pierce him in the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoals; and accordingly God is ſaid not to ſpare his own Son, but to deliver him up into the hands of Sathan, for us all, to try the combate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. So <hi>David</hi> ſaid, The Lord bade <hi>Shemei</hi> to curſe <hi>David:</hi> For ſaith Dr <hi>Preſton</hi> In Gods All-Sufficiency, There is no creature in heaven or earth that ſtirreth without a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and without a warrant from the Maſter of the houſe. God ſent Sathan to bee a lying ſpirit in the mouth of <hi>Ahabs</hi> falſe Prophets; God is without all cauſes, and the cauſe of all things; no creature ſtirs but at his command, and by his providence, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. 14. And thus <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> the Devils Agents, did unto Chriſt, whatſoever God had before determined to be done, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. and thus God declared his will to Sathan, Thou ſhalt pierce the ſeed of the deceived Woman in the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoals, as a wicked Malefactor; but yet for all this, he ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue obedient, and at laſt break thy Head-plot by his ſacrifice of Reconciliation; fleſh and blood could not effect this way of conſecration. The Father delivered Chriſt to death, ſaith <hi>P. Mart.</hi> not that the Father is bitter or cruel, hee delighted not in evil, as it is evil: But I may adde, he delighted to ſee him combate with Sathan, not for the evil ſake that fel upon Chriſt, but for the good of his obedience in his conſecration to his death and ſacrifice. And all this was done not from the row of cauſes, as in Courts of juſtice from the imputation of the guilt of our ſins; but from the voluntary Cauſe and Covenant only.

                  <hi>Reply</hi> 7. It is a plain evidence that the Doctrine of imputing our ſins to Chriſt as our legal Surety, is a very unſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, becauſe it hath no better ſupports hitherto than Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture miſ-interpreted. The ſenſe of this Text is this; <hi>The ſoul that ſins, i. e.</hi> the very ſoul that ſins, namely, the very ſame nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l and individual perſon, that ſins formaly and inherently, <hi>ſhall die;</hi> for the text ſpeaks plainly of ſin committed, and it argues that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> took little heed to the circumſtances of the Text, that did not mark that; and the Text ſheweth the effect that ſin hath upon a ſinner (that repents no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>) namely, he ſhall dye.</p>
               <p>Now to this Expoſition compare Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> Anſwer; <hi>Man ſinned</hi> (ſaith he) (mark his evaſion,) for he doth not ſpeak this of man numerically taken, as the Text doth, but he ſpeaks it of man generally, or of all mankind in <hi>Adam; Ergo, man died</hi> (ſaith he) here he takes the word man, not for the particular individual ſinner, as the Text doth, but for the individual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt; and ſo his meaning amounts to this, Mankind ſinned, and Chriſt died. By this the Reader may ſee that his Expoſition agrees with the Text, no better than Harp and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
               <p>Therefore unleſs Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> do affirm that Chriſt was a ſinner formally and inherently, he cannot from this place of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> gather that Chriſt was to ſuffer the ſecond death; neither can he gather it from <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. becauſe both theſe places ſpeak of ſin as it is formally committed, and not alone of the effects of ſin (as guilt.) Neither of theſe Scriptures do admit of dying by a Surety; neither doth the Law any where elſe admit of dying ſuch a death as the ſecond death is, by a Surety, to deliver other ſinners from that death, as theſe Scriptures do teſtifie, <hi>Pſ. 49. 7, 8, 9. Job</hi> 36. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the ſting of death is ſin,</hi> but his meaning is plainly of ſin inherent, and not of ſuch an imputation of ſin as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> makes to be the ground of Chriſts ſuffering the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death.</p>
               <p>Adams <hi>firſt ſin,</hi> ſaith Bucanus, <hi>was common to all mens nature; but his other ſins,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>were truly perſonal, of which Ezek.</hi> 18. 20. the ſoul that ſinneth ſhall die.</p>
               <p>But I wonder that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth cite <hi>Auſtin</hi> for the ſpiritual
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:64895:75"/>
death of Chriſts ſoul from Gods imputing our ſins to him, <hi>Auſtin</hi> (ſaith he in p. 130.) <hi>calleth it a death, not of condition, but of crime;</hi> it is as evident as the ſun, that <hi>Auſtins</hi> meaning is this, Chriſt was not neceſſitated to die through any ſinful condition of nature, as fallen man is; but that he was put to death as a criminal perſon by the Jews ſinful imputations; and that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> infers, it was therefore juſt, that ſeeing the devil had ſlain him who owed nothing, the debtors whom he held in durance, beleeving in him that was ſlain without cauſe, ſhould be ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; See <hi>Auſtins</hi> ſenſe more at large in <hi>Wotton de Recon. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

croſs, and ſo he won the prize, namely, the ſalvation of all the Elect.</p>
               <p>According to this way of puniſhment, Chriſt ſuffered our puniſhments; no puniſhment was due to him from the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſin; and therefore no puniſhment was inflicted on him from Gods anger, as our puniſhments are: We indeed do juſtly ſuffer, according to that Court-language which Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> hath expreſſed; but Chriſts puniſhments, though they were as true puniſhments in ſenſe and feeling as ours are (and more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to his nature, than to us) yet they were not inflicted on him from the ſame compulſory ground and Law as ours are on us; but all his were from the voluntary Law and Covenant, as I have before declared. And in chap. 12. at Concluſ. 1. I have ſhewed, that any imputation of ſin in the voluntary combate doth loſe the prize.

he had come far nearer to the true cauſe of Chriſts Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, than by making his Agony to proceed from the compulſory cauſe, <hi>Being preſſed under the wrath of God;</hi> it ſeems his word preſſing doth allude to that violent conſtraint that is uſed to preſs out the blood of grapes; but yet it is alſo beyond it, becauſe he makes the wrath of God to preſs out clods of blood in Chriſt; it makes me tremble at ſuch expreſſions of violence from Gods immediate wrath againſt Chriſt.

But Mr. <hi>Burges</hi> on <hi>Juſtific.</hi> p. 176. ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt as God Man, was not bound by any imputation of ourguilt;</hi> And he cites <hi>Zanchy</hi> for this. The fore-quoted Author (ſaith he)
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64895:77"/>
makes this objection to himſelf, How Chriſt could be ſaid to be freed from the guilt of ſin who had no ſin? He anſwereth, the perſon of Chriſt is conſidered two waies, 1. In it ſelf as God Man, and ſo Chriſt was not bound by any guilt; 2. as appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Head, and ſo repreſenting our perſons, in this reſpect God laid our iniquities upon him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. My drift in citing this, is to ſhew, That ſuch learned Divines as <hi>Zanchy</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burges</hi> is, do deny that the guilt of our ſins were imputed to Chriſt as God Man, contradicting Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> therein.</p>
               <p>Chriſt in his obeying (ſaith <hi>P.

Martyr,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> kind of imputation? Surely by Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſin to the Mediator in both his Natures, the God-head of Chriſt did not obey as a Friend to his Friend to the death, as <hi>P.

               <p>Now let the judicious Reader judge, whether ſome of theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions do not exceed the bounds of his ſaid third Diſtinction; for there he makes the imputation of guilt, to be the obligation to puniſhment: But in ſundry of thoſe ſpeeches of his, which I have repeated, he goes further, than I beleeve moſt men could imagine, by his ſaid Diſtinction; and he doth all along make Chriſts ſufferings to be from the imputation of ſin, that ſo he might deſerve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſaith <hi>P. Martyr</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. p. 124. God is not to be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to order, neither ought he to be ordered by humane Laws; But Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth all along put Chriſts ſufferings into the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Juſtice, according to the order of humane Courts and Laws, namely, by infliction of puniſhment from the imputation of ſin.</p>
               <p>And ſaith <hi>P. Martyr</hi> in p. 111. It is much to be marvelled at how the <hi>Pelagians</hi> can deny that there is original ſin in Infants, ſeeing they ſee that they daily die; but (ſaith he) here ought we to except Chriſt only, who, although he knew not ſin, yet died he for our ſakes; But death had not dominion over him, becauſe that he of his own accord ſuffered it for our ſakes. And the like ſpeech of his I have cited in chap. 10. at Reply 2. By which ſpeechs it is evident, that <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> could not hold the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſins to Chriſt, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth, but he held that Chriſt bore our ſins, namely, our puniſhments, according to the antient Orthodox, and no otherwiſe, and that phraſe and ſenſe is according to the Scriptures, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. but that ſenſe is very far from the ſenſe of Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> imputation, for the firſt ſort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to the voluntary cauſe, but Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> kind muſt be ranked with the compulſory cauſe of Chriſts ſufferings, according to Courts of juſtice.</p>
               <p>But I would fain know of Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> what was the ſin that God imputed to <hi>Iſaak,</hi> for which he commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to kill his Son for a ſacrifice, did not God command it rather for the trial of <hi>Iſaaks</hi> obedience, as well as of <hi>Abrahams?</hi> for in that act of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience <hi>Abraham</hi> was the Prieſt, and <hi>Iſaack</hi> was the Sacrifice, and in that act both of them were a lively type of the obedience of Chriſt, who was both Prieſt and Sacrifice in his own death and Sacrifice; doubtleſs, if <hi>Abraham</hi> had killed <hi>Iſaack,</hi> it had not been from the imputation of any ſin to him, but in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to a voluntary poſitive command of God, and not to a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral command from ſin imputed, for then it had been grounded on the copulation of cauſes wrapped one in another, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> would have Chriſts death to be; but the Scripture imputes no ſin to Chriſt, but makes him the Holy one of God in all his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
               <p>In our judging of the ways of God (ſaith Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> in his Treatiſe of <hi>God without cauſes,</hi> p. 143.) we ſhould take heed of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64895:78"/>
framing a model of our own, as to think, that becauſe ſuch a thing is juſt, therefore the Lord wills it; The reaſon of this conceit (ſaith he) is, becauſe we think that God muſt go by our rule; we forget this, That every thing is therefore juſt, becauſe the Lord doth firſt will it, and not that God doth will it, becauſe it is firſt juſt; but we muſt proceed in another manner, we ſhould firſt find out what the will of God is, for in that is the rule of Juſtice and Equity. So far Dr. <hi>Preſton.</hi>

               <p>And it is now manifeſted, that the Rule of God from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was, that Chriſt ſhould be the ſeed of the woman to break the Devils head-plot by his bleſſed Sacrifice, and that he ſhould be ſuch a High Prieſt as is holy and harmleſs, and ſeparated from ſinners, and that he ſhould be a Lamb without ſpot and blemiſh, and therefore without all imputation of ſin in the ſight of God, and of his Law, and that he ſhould be conſecrated through af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. and 5. 9. and 10. 20. and to this end ſhould, as a voluntary Combater, enter the Liſts with Satan, &amp;c. as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid.</p>

THis Diſtinction makes two Hells, that have the ſame Eſſential Torments, one Temporary, and the other Eternal; one for Chriſt alone in this world, and the other for Reprobates in the world to come. By the like Reaſon there are two Heavens that have the ſame Eſſential bleſſedneſſe, the one Temporary, and the other Eternal; for if Scripture may be judge, there are as many Heavens for Eſſential bleſſedneſſe, as there are Hells for Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial torment.</p>

                  </gap> the judicious Reader may well ſmile at this odde Diſtinction; and yet I do not ſee how Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> can maintain, that Chriſt ſuffered the Eſſential Torments of Hell, without this Diſtinction.</p>
               <p>This penal Hell was firſt deviſed, and is ſtill maintained, for <note place="margin">It is a meer fantacy to ſay that Chriſt ſuffered the eſſential Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell in this world, ſeeing it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are not in full Torments here.</note> the ſake of Chriſts ſufferings only; I never heard it uſed in Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> ſenſe for any body elſe, no not for the Devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as long as they are in this world: For firſt, ſaith Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> in page 124. the full Torments of Hell are not inflicted upon the Devils before the day of Judgement. Secondly, neither dares he affirm that any man in this life did ever ſuffer the Eſſential torments of Hell: For in page 115. (he ſaith) That the reaſon why Eternal death is inflicted after the ſeparation of the ſoul from the body, is, partly becauſe of the inability of the nature of man in this preſent ſtate of mortality to indure the wrath of God without ſeparation of the ſoul from the body; namely, to indure Gods penal wrath (as hee doth preſently after call it) ſuch as Chriſt bare: And in Chap. 13. he
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64895:79"/>
ſaith, There may be ſome doubt concerning the capacity of a meer creature, to hold ſuch a meaſure of Torment.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Hence it follows from his own confeſſion, that no mortal man can ſuffer the penal wrath of God, or the Eſſential Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell in this life.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Hence it follows, that there is no ſuch penal Hell for any other in this life, but for Chriſt alone.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That none (but Chriſt) can dye the ſecond Death, till they be firſt dead in ſin.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Neither dares Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> affirm, that Chriſt ſuffered the Eſſential Torments of Hel in this penal Hell by Gods ordinary diſpenſation: For in Page 120. he ſaith, <hi>That according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary diſpenſation of God, the full pains of hell are not ſuffered in this life: But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>according to the extraordinary diſpenſation of God, Chriſt not onely could, but did ſuffer the pains of Hell in this life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And truly, ſeeing this penal Hell hath need of miracles to ſupport it, it ſhall have my vote to be matched with Purgatory, as a like fiction.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth labour to confirm his ſaid Diſtinction by the School-men; For in page 120. hee ſaith, The ſounder School-men teach that Chriſt was in ſuch a penal Hell, namely, where he ſuffered the Eſſential torments of Hell before his death; But in caſe the School-men did not teach ſo much, then Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth wrong both them, and the Reader, to cite them to his ſenſe.

That the Eſſential part of Hell torments was that, and only that, which Chriſt ſuffered.</p>
                  <p>But here he is forced to leave that Principle, and to flye to that which is Equivalent; ſometimes he holds cloſe to the very letter of the Law, as if God could not alter one jot, becauſe Chriſt was in the ſame obligation with <hi>Adam,</hi> but preſently after, hee doth admit of the word Equivalent; ſuch uncertainty there is in his foundation-principles.</p>

                  <p>3. MR. <hi>Norton</hi> labours to confirm his ſaid diſtinction of a local and penal Hell, by this Scripture, <hi>Thou wilt not leave</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 16 10. Act. 2. 27. It is to admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth interpret Hell in the ſame Scripture, firſt to ſignifie Hell torments, and then only the the Grave.</note> 
                     <hi>my ſoul in Hell;</hi> this is cited in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 10. and in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 27. The ſoul, ſaith he, in page 39. is underſtood by judicious and learned Authors properly, Hell Metaphorically, for ſuch pains as are equivalent to the pains of Hell it ſelf. But yet Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth fully contradict and confute, both himſelf and his learned and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Authors; for in page 110. he ſaith, That the word <hi>Hades</hi> in the, Creed is doubtleſſe to bee interpreted according to ſome ſenſe wherein it is uſed in the Scripture; But ſaith he in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 27. <hi>It is taken for the Grave.</hi> Here he affirms it is taken for the Grave, and yet in the place fore-cited, he ſaith, It is taken for the pains of Hell it ſelf, by the judgement of learned and judicious Authours. I confeſſe I cannot but wonder that hee ſhould make hell in one and the ſame text to ſignifie ſuch different things; it is a manifeſt teſtimony of the uncertainty of his judgement.</p>
                  <p>2 If <hi>Haides</hi> in Greek, and <hi>Sheol</hi> in Hebrew, and <hi>Hell</hi> in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, ſignifie no more but the Grave in the ſaid Scriptures, then
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64895:81"/>
I wonder how Mr.<hi>Norton</hi> can interpret the word Soul properly, of the immortal Soul of Chriſt, as he doth with the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of learned and judicious Authors; Doth the ſame Scripture in the ſame words, affirm that Chriſts immortal Soul did one while ſuffer the pains of hell in this life, and another while lye buried with his body in the Grave? Is not this to make the holy Scripture to be no better than a leaden Rule to bee bowed this way, &amp; that way, after the fantaſies of men at their pleaſures?</p>
                  <p>He tells mee in page 258. That the Scripture lyeth not in the ſound of words, but in the ſenſe; but in this hee doth halt of his own ſore, and therefore I retort his own words to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that moſt peſtilent Doctrines have oftentimes been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated in the language of the Scripture, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>3 Saith Mr.<hi>Norton</hi> in page 39. The ſoul in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 10. and <hi>Act.</hi> 2 27. is by judicious and learned Authors underſtood properly; If Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> do approve the judgement of thoſe learned and judicious Authors to the Reader, why then doth he in page 110. take Hell for the Grave; was his ſoul (properly taken) buried in his Grave? Secondly, why doth Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> blind the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by ſaying that learned and judicious Authors do take the word Soul properly? ſeeing hee cannot be ignorant that other learned and judicious Authors take the Soul there for the vital ſoul only, that liveth and dyeth with the body, &amp; that ſoul might be diſlocated in his body when he dyed, and ſo it might be buried with his body in the grave.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Ainſ.</hi> on the word Soul in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 10. in his concluſion ſaith thus, Compare it (namely this word Soul) with the like in other places, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 8. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 49. and 88. 4. and 94. 17. (all which places are clearly meant of the vital ſoul) and then hee makes application of this to Chriſt: Chriſt (ſaith he) gave his ſoul for the Ranſome of the world, and powred it out to death, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 11, 15, 17. and 15. 13. and at the laſt he ſaith thus, theſe words, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in bell,</hi> teach us Chriſts Reſurrection; as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Thou will not leave me to the power of Death, or Grave, to be conſumed.</hi> Mark this cloſe of Mr. <hi>Ainſworths,</hi> hee interprets Hell to bee Death, or the Grave.</p>
                  <p>2 Mr. <hi>Broughton,</hi> in his two Works defenſive, expounds <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 10. thus, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my vital ſoul to Death;</hi> In theſe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64895:81"/>
words he expounds Chriſts ſoul to be his vital ſoul, and <hi>Sheol,</hi> Hell, to be Death (as <hi>Bucer</hi> did at fourthly above) <hi>Thou wilt not leave my vital ſoul to Death,</hi> and by a conſequent (ſaith <hi>Bro.)</hi> nor my body in the Grave, nor my ſoul among ſouls, till my body ſee corruption.</p>
                  <p>And in his explication of the Article of <hi>Deſcent into Hell,</hi> page 16. he ſaith thus, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> both citing this 16. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> do cite it to no further death then that which all muſt feel.</p>
                  <p>3 Mr. <hi>Carliſle</hi> ſaith thus on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 10. <hi>Thou wilt not leave</hi> Nephes, <hi>my body in the Grave,</hi> for indeed the vital ſoul is a part of <note place="margin">In his book againſt Chriſts local Deſcent. p. 32.</note> the body; and thus ſpeaks our larger Annotations on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 10. I confeſſe it is to my admiration that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that expoſition of the word Soul, for Chriſts immortal ſoul, properly, and yet by <hi>Sheol,</hi> and <hi>Haides</hi> doth underſtand no <note place="margin">The ſoul in the N. T. is often put for the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſoul.</note> more but the Grave in page 110. And thus you ſee that Mr.<hi>Norton</hi> hath confounded his own Diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>The Hebrew <hi>Nepheſh,</hi> and the Greek <hi>Pſuche,</hi> which we call Soul, ſaith <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> in Pſ. 16. 10. hath the name of Breathing and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring; and (ſaith he) it is the vital ſpirit that all quick things move by, therefore beaſts, birds, fiſh, and creeping things, are called <hi>Living ſouls, Gen.</hi> 1. 20. 24. and this ſoul is ſometimes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>The blood, Gen.</hi> 9. 4. becauſe it is in the blood of all quick things, <hi>Lev.</hi> 17. 11. 2 <hi>Chriſtopher Carliſle</hi> proves on the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of <hi>Deſcent,</hi> page 144. 153. that <hi>Nepheſh</hi> is never uſed for the immortal ſoul in all the Old Teſtament; and ſaith Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 23. <hi>Pſuche,</hi> the ſoul, doth ordinarily in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſignifie <hi>The life;</hi> and ſaith <hi>Carliſle</hi> in p. 155. <hi>Pſuchee</hi> doth ſignifie the immortal ſoul but in three places, namely, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 27. 28. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. and (ſaith he) in the New Teſtament it ſignifies for the moſt part that which <hi>Nephes</hi> doth in the Old.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, he makes it to ſignifie the fear of death in Chriſts humane nature, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 38. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. 34.</p>
                  <p>But thirdly, Though <hi>Neſhemab</hi> doth alſo ſignifie the vital ſoul, yet tis never uſed for the vital ſoul of the unreaſonable creatures, as <hi>Nepheſh</hi> is, but only of man, and therefore the Hebrews do often underſtand by it the immortal or the rational ſoul. See <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> upon <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. 21. 7. 5. And ſaith <hi>Carliſle</hi> in p. 162. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhemah</hi> hath its name of <hi>Shamaim</hi> Heaven, for that the immortal ſoul cometh from Heaven.</p>

                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:64895:82"/>
Theſe things conſidered, I think Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> hath but little ground to perſwade his Reader from his learned Authors, that the word Soul in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 10. is to be underſtood properly of the immortal Soul of Chriſt.</p>

                        </gap> or tittle ſhall in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe paſs from the Law, till all be fulfilled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Scripture Mr.<hi>Norton</hi> doth cite ſeveral times, 1. To prove that Chriſt fulfilled the Law by ſuffering the Eſſential puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Curſe for us, as in p. 10. 104. 213.</p>
                  <p>2 He doth alſo often cite it, to prove that Chriſt, as God-Man Mediator, fulfilled the Law in a way of works for us, as in p. 152, 192, 197, 240, 267.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, ſeeing he doth lay ſuch great weight upon this Text, I think it needful to examine the true ſenſe of this Text, and then it will appear that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth pervert the true ſenſe of it to his corrupt ends.</p>
                  <p>This Text of <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 17. 18. doth ſpeak of Chriſts fulfilling <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 17, 18.</note> the Law; but not in reſpect of his own perſonal conformity to it (as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> would have it to ſpeak) but it ſpeaks of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling it by filling up the ſpiritual ſenſe of it, which was ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Scribes and Phariſees; he fulfilled, that is to ſay, he
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64895:83"/>
filled up the true Interpretation of it in its latitude, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating of the inward man as well as of the outward, in the way of ſanctified obedience: In this ſenſe <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt came to fulfill the Law;</hi> and in this ſenſe it did belong to his Mediators Office, as he was the Prophet of his Church, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke the Scribes and Phariſees for deſtroying the ſpiritual ſenſe of the Law, by their litteral and corrupt Interpretations; But ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I came to fulfill it,</hi> by giving the ſpiritual ſenſe and meaning of it, for the regulating of the inward man as well as of the outward, as ver. 21, 27, 33, 38, 43. do plainly ſhew; And then he concludes with an exhortation in ver. 48. <hi>Be ye therefore perfect, as your Father which is in heaven is perfect;</hi> namely, be perfect in Expoſition and Doctrine, for it is the perfect rule of an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right life and converſation.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Ioſeph Mead</hi> on <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 17. ſaith thus, Think not that I <note place="margin">In his <hi>Diatribae</hi> or diſcourſes on ſeveral Scriptures.</note> am come to take away the obligation of the Rule of mans duty to God, and to his Neighbor, given firſt by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Law, and afterward repeated and inculcated by the Prophets; but to fulfill them, that is, to ſupply or perfect thoſe Rules and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of juſt and unjuſt contained in them, by a more ample inetrpretation, and other improvement befitting the ſtate of the Goſpel. For ſurely, ſaith he, this muſt be the meaning of this ſpeech of our Saviour; if we be more willing (as we ſhould) to take a ſenſe from the Scripture, than to bring one to it, doth not the whole context (ſaith he) evince it? And in p. 55. he cites <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to the ſame ſenſe (our Lord ſaith <hi>Irenaeus)</hi> inſtead <note place="margin">Irenaeus.</note> of <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery,</hi> commands not ſo much as to luſt; Inſtead of <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> not ſo much as to be angry; Inſtead of <hi>to tithe,</hi> to diſtribute all we have to the poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which, ſaith he, is not of one that diſſolves the Law, but fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and inlargeth it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Mr. <hi>Bruges</hi> ſaith, Although it be true, that Chriſt <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vindiciae legis,</hi> p. 177.</note> may be ſaid to fulfil the Law divers wayes; yet I think he ſpeaks here moſt principally for his Doctrinal fulfilling of it; for he oppoſeth teaching the Law, to breaking the Law.</p>
                  <p>And in p. 253. he ſaith thus, Chriſt is ſaid to fulfill the Law in reſpect of the Phariſees, who by their corrupt gloſſes, had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuated it, and in p. 273. <hi>lect.</hi> 29. He opens <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 17. 18. to his former ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:64895:83"/>
Thirdly, <hi>Tindal</hi> ſaith thus, Here haſt thou, dear Reader, an <note place="margin">In his Prolog &amp; in Mat. 5. 17, 18.</note> Expoſition of <hi>Matth.</hi> 5, 6, and 7. Chapters, wherein Chriſt our ſpiritual <hi>Iſaak</hi> hath digged again the Wells of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which the Scribes and Phariſees had ſtopped and filled up with the earth of their falſe Expoſitions; he reſtoreth the key of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>And on verſ. 17. he ſaith thus, I came not to deſtroy the Law, but to repair it onely, and to make it go upright where it halteth.</p>
                  <p>And preſently after, I do but onely wipe away the filth and rotten gloſſes wherewith the Scribes and Phariſees have ſmeared the Law.</p>
                  <p>And ſaith he in verſ. 21, 22. Chriſt beginneth not to deſtroy the Law, as the Phariſees had falſly accuſed him, but to reſtore it again to the right underſtanding, and to purge it from the gloſſes of the Phariſees.</p>
                  <p>And ſaith he in verſ. 48. This Text doth not ſay ye ſhall be as perfect as God, but perfect after his example: To be perfect (ſaith he) is to have pure Doctrine without falſe Opinions, and that thy heart be to follow that learning.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Dr. <hi>Barnes</hi> anſwers the Popiſh Juſticiaries thus, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Barns in Tindal</hi> p. 229.</note> Our Maſter Chriſt in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. doth there reprove the falſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation which they did ſet to the Law, but he teacheth no new works, nor is a giver of any new Law.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Marlorat</hi> on <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 17, 18. ſaith, The Law is deſtroyed or broken, when it is made void and of none effect by falſe Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and traditions of men, or elſe by a wicked life; but here he underſtandeth the deſtroying of the Law after the firſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, namely, by falſe expoſitions, and therefore it follows, that Chriſt came to fulfill it by filling up the ſenſe, for the regulating of the inward as well as of the outward man.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> on <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 18. ſaith thus, Chriſt indeed as <note place="margin">
                        <hi>In vindiciae Fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deris,</hi> p. 49. See alſo Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not on Mat. 5. 17, 18 &amp; in his Practical Cat. p. 104, 105. in his 5. Edition.</note> ſoon as he publickly appeared in the work of Redemption, was charged that he came to deſtroy the Law, but this he did utterly diſavow, profeſſing, that he <hi>came not to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfill it.</hi> and ſaith he (preſently after) Chriſt aſſerts a neceſſity of a higher degree of obedience than the Scribes and Phariſees taught or practiſed, ſaying, <hi>Except your righteouſneſs exceed, &amp;c.</hi> which muſt be underſtood of righteouſneſs inherent, in conformity to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64895:84"/>
the Law, as it appears by the precedent words, and is more fully confirmed in the words that follow; and upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Chriſt openeth the Commandements of the Law, and how far we muſt tranſcend them, if ever we come to the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>And to this purpoſe doth Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> expound <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 18. on the Covenant. p. 111.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, I will now conclude with Mr. <hi>Calvin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Although (ſaith <hi>Calvin)</hi> Chriſt might worthily have boaſted that he came to fulfill the Law with the perfection of his life, yet here, notwithſtanding, he treateth of Doctrine, and not of his Life.</p>
                  <p>You ſee that <hi>Calvin</hi> doth deny that Chriſt ſpake of fulfilling the Law in <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 18. in Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> ſenſe; he treates here, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Calvin</hi> on Mat. 5 17, 18.</note> ſaith <hi>Calvin,</hi> of Doctrine, and not of his life, much leſs of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the eſſential puniſhment of the curſe, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> would have this Text to ſpeak for the proof of his Aſſumption.</p>
                  <p>I may juſtly retort his own words againſt himſelf, in p. 145. Let not the Reader be moved with the multitude of Scriptures which he hath miſ alledged againſt the Dialogue: but know, the erring and private interpretation of them to be but a very fallacy, of putting that for a cauſe which is not a cauſe; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that which is not a divine Teſtimony, for a divine Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: The letter of the Scripture alleged not according to its ſenſe, is not Scripture. No Hereticks or Hetrodox, as ſuch, ever cited the word of God.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> I deny the <hi>major,</hi> for I have ſhewed in Chap. 2. that if it were indeed true, that Chriſt was a Surety in the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation with <hi>Adam,</hi> to pay his debt of obedience, and to ſuffer the curſe of his diſobedience, according to the conditions of the firſt Covenant, Then 1. Chriſt muſt go to the land of <hi>Eden</hi> to eat of the tree of Life, that ſo he may truly perform that act of obedience for <hi>Adam.</hi> And 2. He muſt be dead in ſin, that ſo he may ſuffer the curſe of his diſobedience, for his ſinful act in eating of the tree of Knowledge of good and evill. If Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> will ſay, that theſe things could not be done and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Chriſt; thence I infer, that Chriſt then was not a Surety in the ſame obligation with <hi>Adam,</hi> to pay his proper debt of obedience, and to ſuffer his proper curſe in kind.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I deny the <hi>minor;</hi> namely, that Chriſt was ſuch a Surety; that place cited to prove it in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. is miſerably abuſed to his ſenſe; and yet he doth often cite it to prove his ſenſe of the word Surety; and he puts very great weight on the word Surety in his ſenſe, and therefore he doth repeat it above twenty or thirty times, and his proof is ſtill from <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. as in pag. 85. 149, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:64895:85"/>
Therefore I will now examine the ſenſe of the word <hi>Surety,</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. and then it will appear to have a differing ſenſe <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 22.</note> from Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>The Text ſpeaks thus,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By ſo much was Ieſus made a Surety of a better Teſtament,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by ſo much as Gods oath is a more infallible aſſurance of the perpetual Prieſthood of Chriſt, above the temporary Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, by ſo much is the Prieſthood of Chriſt to intercede for us more certain than theirs.</p>
                  <p>For when the Covenant of the Prieſthood was conferred and <note place="margin">See <hi>Aiaſ.</hi> in Lev. 8. 36.</note> confirmed unto the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> in <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons <hi>Lev.</hi> 8. (which Covenant was life and peace, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 5. called alſo Gods Covenant of peace, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 13. for God gave the office and maintenance to the Prieſts by Covenant, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 7, 8. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 27, 35.) they were made Prieſts without an oath (becauſe God would be at liberty to alter that Covenant) alſo they were many Prieſts, becauſe they were not ſuffered to continue by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of death.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Prieſts ſerved unto the example and ſhadow of heavenly things, offering gifts and ſacrifices, which could not make him that did the ſervice perfect, as pertaining to the conſcience; for they were carnal Ordinances impoſed on them till the time of Reformation, that is, until the coming of Chriſt, who is now ſprung out of the Tribe of <hi>Iudab,</hi> and was made a Prieſt of God with an oath, and a Surety of a better Teſtamental-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes; and becauſe he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for ever, he hath a Prieſthood that paſſeth not from him to another.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Dr. <hi>Hammon</hi> doth thus paraphraſe upon <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 20, 21, 22.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God ſnare, and will not repent,</hi> which (ſaith he) is an argument of the immutability and weightineſs of the matter, and of the ternal continuance of this Prieſthood of Chriſt, and ſo of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence of it beyond the <hi>Aaronical,</hi> which was not eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God with an Oath; and ſo much as a durable, immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and eternal Prieſthood, is better than a tranſitory, mutable, and final Prieſthood (ſuch as the Levitical, being fixt in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal perſons, one ſucceeding the other, and as was it ſelf mortal, not to laſt any longer than till the coming of Chriſt) ſo much
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64895:85"/>
better was that Covenant, wherein Chriſt was Sponſor and Surety for God, that it ſhould be made good to us on Gods part, confirmed to us by Chriſt in the Goſpel; a better Covenant than that of the Law, wherein <hi>Moſes</hi> undertook for God to us.</p>
                  <p>This Scripture thus expounded, is ſo far from confirming Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> ſenſe of the word <hi>Surety,</hi> that it utterly over-turnes it.</p>
                  <p>For this Expoſition makes Chriſt to be Gods Prieſt, and Gods Surety to us; but Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> makes this Surety to be our Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God in the ſame obligation with <hi>Adam</hi> to the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>The Prieſts in the Law were ordained by God, to make at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for the people for their ceremonial ſins, by ſprinkling the blood of their ſacrifices on the Altar for their attonement; but Chriſt was ordained by an oath firſt made to <hi>David, Pſa.</hi> 110. That <hi>be would raiſe a Prieſt out of his loyns after the order of</hi> Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech, and that by his own blood he ſhould make attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to aſſure their conſcience of the pardon of all their moral ſins, and ſo he ſhould be Gods Surety of a better Teſtamental-Covenant, as Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> tranſlates is, for the greek ſignifies both a Covenant and a Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>It is called a Covenant (ſaith Mr. <hi>Ball)</hi> in reſpect of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of agreement, and a Teſtament, in reſpect of the manner of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ball</hi> on the Coven. p. 196</note> confirming; a Covenant in reſpect of God; a Teſtament in reſpect of Chriſt, who dyed as a Teſtator, and confirmed by his death the teſtamentary promiſe made before (of God) for the obtaining of the eternal inheritance by the remiſſion of ſins.</p>
                  <p>Hence I conclude, that this word <hi>Surety,</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. cannot be underſtood of Gods making Chriſt to be our Surety in the ſame obligation with <hi>Adam</hi> to the firſt Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For his proof of the conſequence of his Argument by <hi>Rom,</hi> 3. 31. I refer the Reader to my Reply to his oighth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He confirms his Argument by this Reaſon, <hi>We are to know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the Covenant of Grace it ſelf obligeth us to fulfill the Covenant of Works in our Surety.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I grant that the Covenant of Grace doth oblige us
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64895:86"/>
to obſerve the moral Law as a Rule of our ſanctified walking, as I have ſhewed at large in my expoſition of <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 5. in cha. 2. ſect. 2 But the Covenant of Grace doth not oblige us to fulfill the firſt Covenant of Works given to <hi>Adam,</hi> for the Covenant was about things indifferent in their own nature, and it was but temporary, to laſt no longer than till the trial of <hi>Adams</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience or diſobedience was made by one act, as I have ſhewed in Chap. 2.</p>
                  <p>2 In caſe the firſt Covenant had been made in relation to the <note place="margin">

                  <p>
                     <hi>The word</hi> Better <hi>is not to be referred to either Covenant it ſelf, but to the manner of the deſpenſation of the Covenant of Grace under the Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> It is evident that the word <hi>Better</hi> is so be referred to the Covenant of Grace, which is better than the outward, legal, ceremonial Covenant: But it ſeems to me that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth not underſtand the Apoſtles comparative Argument, how Chriſt was made a <hi>Surety of a better Covenant;</hi> but for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders information, I will open my underſtanding of the word <hi>better Covenant.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, Conſider that God made two Covenants with his people <hi>Iſrael</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> Firſt, An outward, typical Covenant.

                  <p>The Ceremonial outward worſhip is called the firſt Covenant, and to it did belong <hi>Dicaiomata,</hi> Ordinances of Divine Service, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 9. which in Ver. 10. are called carnal Ordinances, or Decrees, as M. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> expreſſeth it in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 2. 7.

                     <hi>the Law might be fulfilled in us;</hi> And ſo in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 1. the word Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances doth there denote the ceremonial Ordinances, as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, the Tabernacle, and all the other outward ſervices of the Sanctuary, theſe are called the firſt Covenant, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 1. and the outward performances of theſe Services (though they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted faith to make a ſpiritual application) did <hi>ex opere operato</hi> ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie their perſons in reſpect of their coming into Gods preſence in his Sanctuary; but this firſt Covenant was ordained but for their preſent Tutorſhip, and therefore at the coming of Chriſt they are ſaid to <hi>wax old and to be ready to vaniſh away, Heb.</hi> 8. 13.</p>
                  <p>And by three things all <hi>Iſrael</hi> did enter firſt into this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works. 1. By Circumciſion, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 48. 2.

                  <p>This firſt Covenant was confirmed with the blood of Beaſts, to aſſure them, that if they did carefully obſerve the Ordinances of it, they ſhould be juſtified and cleanſed from their ceremonial ſins, and then they might freely come unto Gods preſence in his Sanctuary, or elſe they might not, under the penalty of being cut off, as I noted before on <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4.</p>
                  <p>The Ordinances of this Covenant were written in a Book which is called the book of the Covenant, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23. 2. <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 4, 7. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 25. 10.</p>
                  <p>But this Covenant of Works did not diſanull the Covenant of Grace that was confirmed (430 years) afore of God, in reſpect of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
                  <p>This Covenant was alſo confirmed by the blood and death of beaſts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 18, 19. and the people entred into an oath and a curſe if they kept not this Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 12. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 10. 29. <hi>And Moſes took the blood, and ſprinkled is on the people, and ſaid, behold the blood of the Covenant that Iebovah bath ſtricken with you, concerning all theſe words,</hi> Exod, 24. 7, 8. and thus the firſt Covenant or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

was not dedicated without blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 18, 23. and this ſprinkling of blood was done with ſcarlet-wool and Hyſop, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 19, 20. according to the manner preſcribed in the Law, <hi>Levz</hi> 14. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>But all theſe ceremonial cleanſings, though they were effectual by Gods Ordinance, <hi>ex opere operate,</hi> to juſtifie the outward man, for their coming into Gods preſence in his Sanctuary; yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith in Chriſt they had no power to cleanſe the Conſcience from their moral ſins; and therefore as ſoon as <hi>Paul</hi> was brought home to Chriſt, he renounced all his former righteouſneſs of the Law, wherein he formerly truſted, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. And, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>If the blood of Buls and Goats, and the aſhes of an Heifer ſprinkling the unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh;</hi> and if the blood of Birds, and water, and hyſop, and ſcarlet, ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh; <hi>How much more</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſhall the blood of Chriſt purge the Conſcience from dead works?

                  <p>Theſe ceremonial Laws did not command that which was good, nor forbid that which was evil in it ſelf, and therefore ſaith <hi>Weems</hi> in his ſecond volume p. 4. the ceremonial Laws are called Statutes that were not good, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 25.</p>
                  <p>Now the Prieſts that did mediate between God and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for the forgiveneſs of their ceremonial ſins by the blood of beaſts, were made Prieſts after the Law of a carnal Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore their office muſt be diſanulled for the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unprofitableneſs of it, and therefore thoſe Prieſts were made without an Oath, becauſe they ſhould be changed; but Chriſt was made a Prieſt by an oath, after the order of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech, And by ſo much was Ieſus made a Surety of a better Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> becauſe God by his oath made him a Surety, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Prieſt for our Moral Reconciliation, according to the promiſes of the <hi>better Teſtament.</hi>

                  <p>And thus have I opened the word <hi>Better Covenant.</hi> Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> makes the firſt Covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> to be the old Covenant, but that is not ſuitable to the Apoſtles Argument; and therfore I make the Ceremonial Covenant at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to be the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the Apoſtles ſenſe in this place, and to be old, and to be

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1. It is as true as Salvation it ſelf, that all the Elect do in themſelves ſuffer that dreadful death in ſin that was denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to mans nature in general, in caſe <hi>Adam</hi> as their head in the firſt Covenant did eat of the tree of Knowledge of good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and that death is the eſſential curſe that is there threatned, as I have ſhewed in chap. 2. ſect. 3.</p>
                  <p>2. In that the Elect do eſcape eternal death, which God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained <note place="margin">The Law is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied either by payment in kind, or by that which is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent.</note> afterwards as a conſequent of that death threatned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. it is from Chriſts ſatisfaction. It is not required by the Rules of Equity, whether Divine or Humane, that ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for wrongs done ſhould alwaies be made in kind, or by way of counter-paſſion; as for example, in caſe a man in his rage ſhould beat his Neighbor, or butcher his Cattel, were it as good and as juſt ſatisfactio for the ſupreme Magiſtrate to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the party wronged to exerciſe the like rage and cruelty on his perſon, or live goods, as it is to award him ſatisfaction by a valuable ſum of mony, or the like? But it is evident, that the Law may be ſatisfied two wayes, 1. Either according to the exact letter of the Law, which requires Eye for Eye, Tooth for Tooth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 24. and ſo for him that ſteales one Ox, five <note place="margin">Exod. 21. 24.</note> Oxen in kind, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 1. Or 2. The Law may be ſatisfied by ſuffering or by paying that which is equivalent to the damage of the Eye loſt: And ſo in caſe a poor man ſteal an Ox, and not able to pay five Oxen for one, yet if his rich friend will pay that which the owner ſhall accept for five Oxen, the Law in the true intent of it is ſatisfied; and ſo the firſt born of man and of beaſt was redeemed with mony, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 15, 16. In like ſort I find this ſentence in the learned, that that is to be held for ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which was mutually agreed on between the Father and the Mediator from Eternity, and to this very purpoſe doth Mr.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64895:88"/>
                     <hi>Gataker</hi> cite that Proverb, <hi>Money is recompenſed by the feet;</hi> and thus Chriſt made ſatisfaction for the Elect; and this is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged even by ſuch as hold that Chriſt made ſatisfaction by ſuffering the wrath of God. There is a two fold payment of debt, ſaith Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> one of the things altogether the ſame in the obligation; and this, <hi>ipſe facto,</hi> freeth from puniſhment, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be paid by the Debtor himſelf, or by the Surety Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a thing which is not altogether the ſame in the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo that ſome act of the Creditor or Governor muſt come unto it, which is called Remiſſion; in which caſe deliverance doth not follow <hi>ipſo facto</hi> upon the ſatisfaction; and of this kind, ſaith he, is the ſatisfaction of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now if Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> meaning be, that except Chriſt did ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the puniſhment due to the Elect in kind, the Law doth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver remain unſatisfied, then I deny the <hi>major;</hi> for the Law may be ſatisfied, though Chriſt did never ſuffer the Curſe in kind.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It cannot be in kind, according to the firſt Covenant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> as I have ſhewed often.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It is evident, that it was from another Covenant made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Trinity, according to the Council of their own will, which Covenant was revealed to <hi>Adam</hi> preſently after the fall, as I have opened it in ſome meaſure.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> in his <hi>Elenchtick Animad.</hi> gives this expoſition of <note place="margin">Upon <hi>Govia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> p. 25. Heb. 10. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10. <hi>I come to do thy will,</hi> by which Will we are ſanctified, through the oblation of his body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Will (ſaith he) is the Stipulation (or Covenant) of the Father, about Chriſts undertaking our cauſe upon himſelf, and performing thoſe things that are requiſite for the expiation of our ſins: therefore it comprehends all the obedience of Chriſt, which he performed to the peculiar Law of Mediation; for this <note place="margin">Chriſt did not make; ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction by ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the firſt Covenant, but by fulfilling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Covenant that was made between the Trinity.</note> Law ſet apart, he was not bound (ſaith he) by any other Law, to the oblation of himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Hence it follows, that if Chriſt made ſatisfaction by another voluntary Covenant between the Trinity, then not by the firſt ſupreme Covenant, made with <hi>Adam.</hi> And to this very purpoſe alſo, doth Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeak, as I have noted in Chap. 3. Sect. 3.</p>

                  <p>This is but humane language, the Scripture doth not ſay ſo; but that which the Scripture ſaith, is this, namely, That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſion of ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22. God told the reſult of the eternal Decree to <hi>Adam,</hi> that the Devil muſt perſecute Chriſt, and ſhed his blood by peircing <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 22. Eſa. 53. 10. Gen. 3 15.

                  <p>And without this combate with Sathan, and without this ſhedding of blood, there is no Satisfaction, and ſo no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
                  <p>But this Death and Sacrifice of Chriſt might be, and was, without any ſuffering from the immediate wrath of God.</p>
                  <p>Though not without Gods appointment and permiſſion to Sathan to do his utmoſt againſt this Seed of the Woman, to ſpoil his obedience if he could, in which conflict Chriſt had his Foot-ſoal pierced, but the Devil had his Head plot broken, <note place="margin">Col. 2. 14, 15.</note>

                  <p>The Apoſtle doth tell us, that we have Remiſſion of ſins by vertue of Chriſts ſatisfaction, namely, by his bloody death and ſacrifice, ſacrifice, <hi>Heb. 9. 15, 26, 28.

                  <p>But if he mean that Chriſt fulfilled the vindicative part of the Law, by ſuffering the puniſhment of the eternal Curſe, which doubtleſſe is the great thing that he aims at, then any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Reader, may eaſily ſee that his Argument doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſo much.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reply,</hi> IF I had met with this Argument in another Book, wherein I had not been concerned, I ſhould have thought it but a ſilly Argument, for neither the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, minor,</hi> nor Concluſion, are without their ſaults.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The Concluſion is faulty, becauſe it comes not up in <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> to what ſhould be concluded and proved.</p>
               <p>For the point of difference, as it is ſtated by Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> but five lines before this Syllogiſm, ſpeaks thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You know, that we affirm and defend, that Chriſt ſuffered the wrath of God, and that in a way of ſatisfaction unto divine Juſtice:</hi> But in this Concluſion of his Syllogiſm, there is never a word of Chriſts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the wrath of God. But bad he made his Concluſion ſo,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64895:92"/>
the Scriptures cited in the <hi>minor</hi> will not bear up ſuch a Concluſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2 His <hi>major</hi> is unſound; for God may be indebted by the meritorious mediatorly obedience of Chriſt, in point of juſtice, <note place="margin">The ground of ſatisfaction to Gods Juſtice ariſeth from the condiſions of the volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Covenant.</note> to rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the reaſon is ſo plain, that he that runs may read it: Namely, becauſe the ground of ſatisfaction to Juſtice ariſeth not from the ſufferings themſelves, as they were threatned to the ſinner for his diſobedience to the firſt Covenant, but from the conditions of the voluntary Covenant, wherein all the Trinity were equally Covenanters, and all the Articles of that Covenant were poſitive Laws, unto which as a voluntary Mediator he yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded obedience, as I have ſhewed in chap. 2.</p>
               <p>The Father propounded his Terms to the ſecond perſon, and the ſecond perſon covenanted to do what he thought fit to accept and perform, and the performance of that was accepted by the Father, as fully ſatisfactory to his juſtice, as payment in kind could have been</p>
               <p>He that doth voluntarily undertake to perform a combate <note place="margin">Obedience per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the Articles of a voluntary Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant doth merit the prize.</note> with his oppoſite Champion, in order to the voluntary Laws and Covenants that were made for the triall of Maſteries; if he did ſtrive and overcome his oppoſite Champion, according to thoſe Laws, did merit the prize, by vortue of that free Covenant, and free performance; ſuppoſe it were for the redemption of Captives that he had deſerved death; Juſtice according to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was as fully ſatisfied by this performance, as if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent, or the voluntary Surety in his place, had ſuffered full puniſhment in kind.</p>
               <p>Again take another inſtance of a voluntary Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per corn paid by a Tenant to his Landlord, according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of a voluntary Covenant, is current pay and ſatisfaction alſo, though not under the notion of a valuable conſideration, yet under the notion of a voluntary bargain and Covenant, mutually agreed to by both parties.</p>
               <p>Theſe inſtances ſhew that the ground of ſatisfaction to juſtice may ariſe as well from the voluntary cauſe as from the

order of natural cauſes. I hope none is ſo weak as to think, that by this laſt inſtance, I value Chriſts ſatisfaction to a pepper corn, for his death and ſacrifice was of infinite value in it ſelf, becauſe it proceeded form his perſon that was infinite: But it was therefore ſatisfactory, becauſe it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ade ſatisfactory by the conditions of a voluntary Covenant; and indeed, nothing of the greateſt value can be called a ſatisfactory price, until it be mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> it was worth, or as good a Vineyard in the place of it; but neither this eminent perſon, nor this valuable conſideration, could be a ſufficient price to purchaſe <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Naboth</hi> did not, nor by the Law could not conſent to make it a price, as I have ſhewed in Chap. 8. Sect. 1. Even ſo, had not the Father Covenanted to accept of the perſon, and of the death, and ſacrifice of Chriſt for our redemption, it had not been a price; but becauſe God did voluntarily Covenant to accept it, therefore it is now the onely full price of ſatisfaction to Gods Juſtice.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems the difference lies in the conditions of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; <note place="margin">The difference in ſtating the voluntary Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, betwixt <hi>Mr. Norton</hi> and my ſelf.</note> for Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> holds that Chriſt Covenanted to do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of his Father, and that his Father willed he ſhould obey the Law of Works, and ſuffer the Eſſential puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Curſe, for the exact fulfilling of the firſt Covenant, as our Surety (as his firſt Propoſition ſpeaks;) and hence he makes all Chriſts ſufferings to be inflicted upon him from Gods vindicative Juſtice, as from the ſupreme Law-giver and Judge; becauſe Chriſt was our Surety, and ſo a ſinner by Gods imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſo he makes the Rule of Gods proceedings in juſtice againſt Chriſt, to be legal, according to the natural order of Courts of Juſtice againſt Delinquents, and therefore he makes all Chriſts obedience, both in his incarnation, life, and death, to be all legal, and to be all grounded on the moral Law.</p>
               <p>But in Cap. 2. I have ſhewed not only ſufficient Reaſons, but alſo the concurrence of eminent Orthodox Divines, that I beleeve will ſufficiently ſatisfie a judicious Reader, that the whole order of Chriſts ſatisfaction is from the voluntary cauſe, and from other
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64895:93"/>
conditions in the voluntary cauſe, and that the voluntary cauſe is never over-ruled by a ſupreme compulſory power, as I have here and there expreſſed in ſundry parts of my Reply. It is true, ſaith a learned Divine, That Chriſt merited, as well as ſatisfied for us; but (ſaith he) that by which he merited was not his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſinning, or perfect obedience (for that was due to the Law under which he was born) but his free and voluntary giving up himſelf to death, without any obligation to that duty lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, as man, ſo to do, according to that of <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 7. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto the death, even the death of the Croſs;</hi> which (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience) is there ſet as the foundation of his merit (wherefore God that highly exalted him.) But all this you ſee is quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother matter from his active obedience, or fulfilling the Law, as being ſo imputed to us: But touching the difference of his mediatorial obedience, from his humane legal obedience, See more in chap. 3.</p>
               <p>I have alſo, I think, ſufficiently ſhewed, that nothing (though never ſo excellent in it ſelf) can be called a price, till it be made a price by a mutual covenant and contract, and therefore when the blood &amp; death of Chriſt is called the price of our redemption, <hi>even before the foundation of the world, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 19, 20. it is a ſure and certain proof to our conſcience, that it was formally made to be the ful price of our redemption, by a mutual Covenant and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract between the Trinity before ever the foundation of the world was laid.</p>
               <p n="3">3 His <hi>Minor</hi> is alſo faulty, as it is to be underſtood in his ſenſe; but let others of a differing judgement, take this ſentence of his <hi>[in point of Iustice]</hi> in their ſenſe, and then ſuch perſons will not ſtumble at the <hi>minor;</hi> But take it as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth expound the Juſtice of the firſt Covenant, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. and then the <hi>minor</hi> muſt be denied, and the Scriptures produced by him to prove it, muſt be ſhewed to be corruptly cited. And therefore for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter clearing of the truth, I will ſearch into the clear ſenſe of thoſe Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That of <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 31. hath already been tried in the ballance of the Sanctuary, and found too light in his ſenſe, in the eighth Argument of the former Chapter.</p>

Secondly, As for that in 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>If we conſeſs our ſins, he is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>juſt to forgive us our ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply</hi> 1. No man will deny that God is juſt in forgiving ſins to ſuch as do truly confeſs them, becauſe the Text <hi>in terminis</hi> doth affirm it. But the great matter of the diſpute is, in what ſenſe is God ſaid to be juſt in forgiving ſins to ſuch as do confeſs them.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſaith, <hi>That God is juſt in forgiving, becauſe he had the ſatisfaction from Chriſt by ſuffering the ſame Eſſential torments of Hell that were threatned to</hi> Adam <hi>in the word</hi> Death, <hi>in</hi> Gen. 2. 17.</p>
               <p>But I have made a ſufficient Reply to this in Chap. 4. Sect. 7. Reply 5. namely, that full ſatisfaction in kind, and free forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, cannot poſſibly ſtand together, becauſe they are contrary to each other.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the bleſſed Trinity, in their voluntary Covenant, did agree that ſuch a performance by Chriſt ſhould be accepted of God for the procuring of his Attonement or Reconciliation to ſuch ſinners, the Holy Ghoſt for Chriſts ſatisfaction ſake did undertake to unite to Chriſt by faith (as the conditoinal promiſes in the New Covenant do teſtifie) Therefore God cannot but ſhew himſelf to be juſt according to his ſaid Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Chriſt, by forgiving the ſins of ſuch ſinners, and ſo cleanſing them from all unrighteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>And thus God is juſt, both according to his Covenant with Chriſt, and alſo according to his new Covenant to beleeving ſinners, revealed to them from his Covenant with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And this was clearly typified in the Law, by the practice of confeſſion of ſin, and by laying their hand on the head of the ſin-offerings for the procuring of their Attonements, in <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 4. and 4. 29. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as I have rightly explained the matter in the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, p. 32, 33, 35, 36, and 155, and in this Reply alſo in Chap. 13.</p>
               <p>So then the ground of Gods Juſtice wherby he hath made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Debtor to forgive the ſins of beleevers, is his voluntary Covenant with Chriſt, namely, that upon his undertaking to perform the Combate with Satan, without any diſobedience to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64895:94"/>
the Laws of the Combate, and at laſt to make his ſoul a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, then he would be reconciled, and forgive the ſins of ſuch ſinners as did beleeve their Attonement thus procured through Chriſts death and ſacrifice, as I have formerly hinted it in my <hi>Reply</hi> to his fourth Propoſition in Chap. 2.</p>
               <p>And this forgiveneſſe (both as it relates to his Covenant with Chriſt, and to his new Covenant with the Elect) is called God Righteouſneſſe in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. and in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. for God muſt needs be as juſt and righteous when he performs his Covenant of Forgiveneſſe made firſt to Chriſt in reference to his ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and ſo made alſo to all the members of his new Covenant, As when he doth execute his vindicative threatnings upon the impenitent; and therefore ſuch poor humble ſinners may by faith call upon God to make them partakers of his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, namely of his gracious forgiveneſſe.</p>
               <p>This Expoſition, How God is juſt, hath a more firm foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in this Text of 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 9. than Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition hath.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> makes God to be juſt in this Text, becauſe he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted ſuch a full ſatisfaction from Chriſt our Surety materially as he hath threatned to ſinners in the moral Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he makes the incarnation and the Death of Chriſt, and all his ſufferings, to be in obedience to the moral Law, which hee calls the inviolable rule of Gods Relative Juſtice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> I on the contrary do therefore make God to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Juſt in this Text, becauſe he declared his Righteouſneſſe in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64895:94"/>
forgiving beleeving ſinners for the ſatisfaction ſake of Chriſt, which he performed according to the voluntary poſitive Law and Covenant, as it was determined in Gods ſecret will, and revealed only in his voluntary poſitive Laws (and not in his moral Law) for his poſitive Laws do often differ, yea they are often contrary to his moral Law. And in my <hi>Reply</hi> to his fifth and ſixth Propoſitions in Chap. 2. and elſewhere, I have ſhewed, that Gods ſecret will declared only in his poſitive Laws (and not in his moral Law) is the inviolable Rule of his Relative Juſtice.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It is acknowledged by many judicious, that there paſſed a voluntary Covenant between the Trinity from Eternity, for mans Redemption, and that God did firſt declare this counſel of his Will in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. namely, that he would put an utter <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> enmity between the Devil in the Serpent, and the ſeed of the deceived Woman, and that the Devil ſhould have ful liberty to deceive this ſeed of the woman, and to pervert his obedience, if he could, by fraud, as he had done <hi>Adam,</hi> or by force, in putting him to an ignominious violent death on the Croſſe by piercing him in the Foot-ſoals; but God declared alſo, that this ſeed of the Woman ſhould not be deceived, but that he ſhould break the Devils Head-plot by continuing conſtant in his obedience to the death, and that he ſhould make his ſoul a ſacrifice in the midſt of his Tortures on the Croſſe, which doubtleſſe was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified <note place="margin">The ground of full and juſt ſatisfaction to Gods juſtice is not by paying our full debt materially, but formally, that God doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for full and juſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which was conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo to be by the conditions of the volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Covenant.</note> to <hi>Adam</hi> by the death and ſacrifice of a Lamb (as I have ſhewed elſewhere) as full ſatisfaction to Gods Juſtice, and as the procuring cauſe of Gods Reconciliation to all that ſhould beleeve in this Promiſed ſeed; for what elſe can bee called full ſatisfaction, but that only that is ſo made by the voluntary Covenant? for the half ſhekels in <hi>Exod.</hi> 30 12. was called the price of the Redemption of their lives; but any man may ſee by <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 8. that materially it was not a full price, until it was made to bee the full price formally only by Gods voluntary poſitive Law and Covenant. Of this ſee more in Chap. 14. Sect. at <hi>Reply</hi> 8.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The performance of the ſaid Combate and Sacrifice on Chriſts part is in Scripture phraſe, called, <hi>The Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt,</hi> and the meritorious nature of it was to bind God the Father to perform his Covenant on his part, which was, that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64895:95"/>
he ſhould be attoned and reconciled to beleeving ſinners, by forgiving their ſins, and receiving them into favour, and the performance of this on God the Fathers part is often in Scripture-phraſe called the Righteouſneſſe of God (as I have ſhewed in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21.) <hi>That ſo he might be juſt, and the Juſtifier of him which beleeveth in Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for the better underſtanding of this 26. verſe, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, and anſwer theſe two Queries.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 How God declared his Juſtice at this time.</item>
                  <item>2 Why at this time.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1 Touching the manner how God declared his Juſtice, that muſt be fetched from its coherence with verſe 25. and there it <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 25.</note> is ſaid, that God declared his juſtice in ſetting forth Chriſt to be a propitiatory, through faith in his blood, for the remiſſion of ſins.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Hence it is evident, that God had covenanted to, and with Chriſt, that if he would undertake to be the ſeed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and in that humane nature to combate with the Enemy, Sathan, to the ſhedding of his blood, and would ſtill continue obedient to the death, and at laſt make his ſoul a ſacrifice, then he ſhould be his Mercy-ſeat, and then he would be reconciled to all beleevers, and forgive them their ſins, through faith in his blood; and therefore as ſoon as ſinners are united to Chriſt by faith, It is Gods Juſtice or his Righteouſneſſe to remit their ſins that are paſt, as I ſhewed before in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 9. and more fully in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 12.</p>
               <p n="2">2 This very name <hi>His</hi> Propitiatory, whence God declares <note place="margin">Chriſt is Gods Mercy-ſeat in point of ſatisfaction. Heb. 4. 16.</note> his Juſtice in remitting ſins, doth plainly tell us, (but that we are dull of hearing) that Chriſts ſatisfaction was not <hi>Solutio ejuſdem,</hi> but <hi>tantidem,</hi> by vertue of the voluntary Covenant, or elſe what need is there that God ſhould declare his juſtice from his Propitiatory, or from his Mercy-ſeat, or from his Throne of grace? as Chriſt by his Satisfaction is called in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16. if Chriſts ſatisfaction had been <hi>ſolutio ejuſdem,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> holds, then it ſhould have been more fitly ſaid that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his juſtice from his Juſtice-ſeat, and not from his Mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat; but becauſe Chriſts death and ſacrifice was (by the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary poſitive Law and Covenant) made to be the <hi>Tantidem</hi> for beleevers, as it is evident by the former inſtance of the half
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64895:95"/>
ſhekels, which was made to be the full price of the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their lives, formally only, by Gods voluntary Covenant, therefore it is moſt fitly ſaid, that God declared his juſtice from his Mercy-ſeat.</p>
               <p n="3">3 This phraſe <hi>(Caporeth)</hi> his Propitiatory, or his Mercy-ſeat, is firſt uſed in <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 17. And it is commonly uſed, ſaith <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> to ſet forth Gods merciful covering of ſins, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. 4. where it is tranſlated by the Seventy, with the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of the Holy Ghoſt, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 5. <hi>Hilaſterson,</hi> that is, a <note place="margin">Pſal. 65. 4.</note> Propitiatory, or a Covering Mercy-ſeat; and ſaith he, this is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the Apoſtle to Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. See more of <hi>Gaphar</hi> in Chap. 14. Sect. 6. <hi>Reply</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>The Hebrew <hi>Caphar,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> is applied to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of an angry countenance, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 20. There <hi>Jacob</hi> is <note place="margin">Gen. 32. 20.</note> ſaid to cover <hi>Eſau's</hi> angry face, or to appeaſe his anger, by a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral and acceptable gift; and this word <hi>Caphar,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> is often uſed in the Law, for the covering or taking away <note place="margin">Chriſts ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is called a ſacrifice of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth appeaſe Gods angry face, &amp;c procure his Attonement to beleeving ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> of offence, by pacifying Gods anger, by gifts and ſacrifices, and typified that Chriſt ſhould give himſelf to be a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sacrifice for the procuring of Gods Attonement whereby ſin is covered, or paſſed by, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 36. <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Lev.</hi> 4. 20. 26. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus Gods angry face was covered, or appeaſed, by the burnt offering of Chriſts body, as ſoon as he had finiſhed all his ſufferings; for he offered himſelf by the holy fire of his eternal Spirit (ſo Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> doth once make the type of Fire to ſpeak in <hi>Noahs</hi> ſacrifice) in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. for as the Altar did ſignifie the <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> God-head of Chriſt, ſo the fire of the Altar muſt be alike type of the God-head of Chriſt alſo; and thus Chriſt was the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the New Teſtament through this kind of death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9 14, 15, 16. by which hee procured Gods Attonement or Reconciliation for the iniquity of the many, and ſo he became his Mercy-ſeat; and after this manner God ſet forth Chriſt to be his Propitiatory through faith in his blood, to declare his Righteouſneſſe by remitting ſins.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> doth open this phraſe <hi>His Righteouſneſſe</hi> (or the juſtice of God) in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21, thus, If a man do more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly conſider this word, the Juſtice or Righteouſneſſe of God, It is the mercy of God which he beſtoweth upon us through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:64895:96"/>
And in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. He calls the juſtice of God, Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe; and ſaith he, I have in another place admoniſhed, <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 3.</note> that the Hebrew word <hi>Tzedec,</hi> which our men have tranſlated Righteouſneſſe, ſignifieth rather Goodneſſe and Mercy; and therefore to this day the Jews call Alms by that name; and ſaith he, <hi>Ambroſe</hi> on this place is of the ſelf-ſame mind; and ſee more how <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> doth expound Gods Righteouſneſſe, in my <hi>Reply</hi> on 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21.</p>
               <p n="5">5 I have alſo ſhewed in the Dialogue, page 118. that <hi>Tzedec,</hi> Juſtice or Righteouſneſſe, is often tranſlated by the Seventy, Goodneſſe or Mercy, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. 5. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 33. 5. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 103. 6. <hi>Eſ.</hi> 1. 27 <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 27. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 13. and their Tranſlation doth well agree to the true ſenſe of <hi>Pſ</hi> 112. 4. 9. and to <hi>Pſ.</hi> 94. 15. where God is ſaid to turn Judgement into juſtice, namely to <note place="margin">Pſal. 94. 15.</note> turn vindicative juſtice, into merciful juſtice; for indeed God hath as exact a way of merciful juſtice by the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, according to the voluntary poſitive Law and Covenant to beleevers, as if the rigor of his moral Curſe had been execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on their Surety in kind, and better too, becauſe the firſt way was conſtituted to be the way, and the other is but imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, according to the legal proceedings of Court-juſtice. And indeed, the Juſtice or Righteouſneſſe of God the Father, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is juſt, according to his Covenant with Chriſt, to forgive them their ſins that do beleeve in the death and ſacrifice of Chriſt, is an example of the higheſt degree of Mercy, Charity, and Alms, that the world can afford.</p>
               <p n="6">6 God is ſaid to judge the world in Juſtice, namely, in his merciful juſtice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96. 13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 98. 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146. 7, 8. And it is ſaid in <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 31. <hi>That God hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in Righteouſneſſe</hi> (ſome underſtand it of Gods vindicative juſtice on the impenitent at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) but <hi>Broughton</hi> reads it in Mercy, or in merciful juſtice, namely, by his Goſpel of grace, declaring his merciful juſtice in judging the world by it; for by his Goſpel of grace, he doth judge the world in favour to their poor, blind, and captivated ſouls, as in <hi>Eſa.</hi> 42. 1, 2. 3 4. and in <hi>Mat.</hi> 12 18. and in <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 31. and <hi>Obad.</hi> verſ. 21. and ſee <hi>Broughton</hi> alſo in <hi>Job</hi> 37. 23.</p>
               <p>By theſe, and ſuch like particulars, we may ſee how God was juſt according to his Covenant with Chriſt, to declare
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64895:96"/>
his righteouſneſs by forgiving the ſins of beleevers for his ſake; and from that Covenant with Chriſt, he hath alſo Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Elect, mercifully <hi>to forgive their iniquities, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their ſins no more,</hi> Jer. 31. 34. which is expounded thus in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 12. I will be pacified or reconciled to their unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; and this is called God the Fathers righteouſneſs, whereby he makes a ſinner righteous.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I come now to anſwer the ſecond Queſtion, <hi>Why did God declare his Juſtice or his Righteouſneſs at this time?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The anſwer is, that he might be juſt, <hi>and the Juſtifier of him that beleeveth in Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God declared the exact time when he would fulfil his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe <note place="margin">The end of Gods merciful juſtice decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from his Mercy-ſeat in Chriſts ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, was, that he might be juſt, and that he might be the juſtifier of beleeving ſinners. Dan. 9. 24. Gal. 4. 4, 5.</note> and Covenant, by his Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> to <hi>Daniel;</hi> namely, that from his prayer, to the death of the Meſſiah, it ſhould be exactly Four hundred and ninety years, and that then the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah by his death and ſacrifice ſhould end all legal ſin-offerings, and finiſh all treſpaſs-offerings, and make reconciliation for iniquity, and (ſo by that means) bring in (or procure) an eternal Righteouſneſs, or an eternal Reconciliation, inſtead of their typical Righteouſneſs; for, by the language of the Law we are taught, that a ſinners righteouſneſs doth conſiſt in Gods reconciliation, or in Gods forgiveneſs, and receiving into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. and in relation to this <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That when the fulneſs of the time.</hi> (ſpoken of by <hi>Daniel) was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the Law</hi> (namely, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law of Rites, that he by his death might fulfil thoſe typical Rites) <hi>to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons:</hi> So then, as Chriſt was juſt in making ſatisfaction according to Covenant in the exact time foretold for man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> redemption; ſo God upon that perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance covenanted to declare his Juſtice at this time to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in all the Nations of the world, that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him that beleeveth in Jeſus, by forgiving their ſins, and not remembring their iniquities, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8 12. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> alſo in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 11. and therefore Chriſt did now ſend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad his Apoſtles, to beſeech men to be reconciled to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I find that Dr. <hi>Hamon</hi> (and others) doth thus paraphraſe upon the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>juſt,</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>Joſeph</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:64895:97"/>
being a juſt man, that is (ſaith he) being a merciful pious man, was not willing to expoſe or ſubject <hi>Mary</hi> to the publick and ſhameful puniſhment, which among the Jews belonged to thoſe women, whom the Husbands, when they firſt came to them, found not to bee Virgins, was willing ſecretly to diſmiſ her, that ſhe not being known to be betrothed to him, might only be liable to the puniſhment of Fornication, <hi>viz.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, not death.</p>
               <p>And in his Annotations, he ſaith thus, The word <hi>Juſt,</hi> in Greek, is anſwerable to the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and ſignifies ordinarily works of Mercy and Charity; of which when <hi>Maymonides</hi> ſets down ſeven ſorts or degrees, the ſeventh is diſtinctly Righteouſneſs or Juſtice, and ſo Juſtice, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 13. both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the context, and the 70 is Mercy. So when Rabbins ſay, There are two Thrones, the one of Judgement, and the other of Mercy; the latter is ſo ſtiled by the Author to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> Chap. 4. 16. and ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 9. he hath given to the poor, and his righteouſneſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> his bounty to the poor, So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 7, 8. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 1. where the vulgar reading is <hi>juſtitiam,</hi> and that for almes in that place.</p>
               <p>Proportionable to theſe acceptions of the word (ſaith he) the righteouſneſs of <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſhall here ſignifie, not ſtrict legal Juſtice, but peculiarly Goodneſs and Clemency, in not bringing <hi>Mary</hi> to the capital puniſhment of ſtoning, for her being with child, according to the I aw, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. but he thought to put her away privately, and ſo to keep the betroth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing private, that ſo ſhe might ſuffer no more but infamy for Fornication. In this point of clemency, is <hi>Joſephs</hi> juſtice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable.</p>
               <p>But on <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 26. he ſaith thus, The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>juſt,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, one that is merciful or charitable, as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 19. And accordingly, it may be obſerved, that the word, ſeldom, in theſe books of the New Teſtament, if ever, belongs, or is applied, to the act of vindicative Juſtice; But as there, in the caſe of <hi>Joseph</hi> (who would not offer his wife to legal puniſhment, and therefore is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>righteous)</hi> for the abating of the rigor of exact Law, and bringing in mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or equity, or mercy inſtead of it.</p>
               <p>Accordingly (ſaith he) it is here to be reſolved, That this
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64895:97"/>
phraſe being uſed of God <hi>[That God may be juſt or righteous]</hi> it muſt be underſtood to denote his mercy, and goodneſs, and clemency in pardoning and forgiving ſins; that being the thing looked on in the many foregoing expreſſions, as <hi>our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified freely by his grace,</hi> in ver. 24. The propitiatory, ver. 25. Gods righteouſneſs, <hi>I. e.</hi> his mercifull dealing with men under the ſecond Covenant, Verſe 25, 26. the remiſſion of ſins, and forbearance, Verſe 25. And (ſaith he) the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>juſt</hi> (or righteous) being ſo commonly taken in the notion of mercifulneſs, and ſo ſeldom in this of vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Juſtice, there is no reaſon to interpret it thus in this place.</p>
               <p>Though this of Dr. <hi>Hamon</hi> do not fully accord to my former interpretation of Gods righteouſneſs, yet his reaſons are very ſolid to ſhew that Gods Juſtice here is not to be taken as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth, for vindicative Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is obſervable, that as the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>juſt,</hi> is often put for one that is pious and merciful, So the 70 put one that is pious, for <hi>Tzedec, juſtice,</hi> in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. 16. and ſo alſo the Hebrew word <hi>Cheſed, mercy,</hi> is put for one that is pious and juſt, and therefore the Seventy do often render it juſtice, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 19. <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21. 23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 24. 27. and in 49, ſee <hi>Ainſ, &amp;</hi> 32. 10. <hi>&amp; Exod.</hi> 15. 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 34. 7. <hi>&amp; Prov.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>&amp; Iſa.</hi> 63. 7. And the reaſon is plain, becauſe Juſtice moderated is Mercy. And to this purpoſe alſo do our larger Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſpeak, on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 31. And ſaith Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> on the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, p. 21. The demonſtration of Gods revenging Juſtice, ſpringeth not from the neceſſity of his nature, but from his voluntary diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>By theſe particulars, I beleeve, it will be evident to the Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that none of all the three Scriptures which Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> hath cited to prove his Aſſumption, do prove it; namely, that Chriſt did ſatisſie Gods Juſtice, by ſuffering his vindicative Juſtice.</p>
               <p>And therefore the point of ſatisfaction, as it is ſtated in the Dialogue, is ſound and good ſtill, notwithſtanding all that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> hath ſaid, or can ſay againſt it.</p>

Though I ſay, that Chriſt did not ſuffer his Fathers wrath, neither in whole or in party, yet I affirm, that he ſuffered all things, in all circumſtances, juſt according to the Predictions of all the Prophets, even to the nodding of the head, and the ſpitting in the face; as theſe Scriptures do teſtifie.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Peter</hi> told the Jews, That <hi>they bad killed the Prince of life, as God before bad ſhewed by the mouth of all his Prophets, that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, and he fulfilled it,</hi> So Act. 3. 17, 18.

                     <hi>This may include</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but certainly excludes not the ſuffering of the wrath of God.</hi>

                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1. He ſhould have ſhewed, that this Scripture did cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly include, that Chriſt did ſuffer from Gods wrath; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeeing it is cited for a proof of the Queſtion ſtated; but I have often ſhewed, that God hath ſhewed from all his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, from <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. that God appointed Satan to ſet all his Inſtruments on work to perſecute Chriſt, and to peirce him in the foot-foals, with an ignominious and painful death, as a Malefactor, on the Croſs, to try if he could pervert him in the courſe of his obedience, and ſo to hinder Chriſts death from being a perfect ſacrifice, by which means onely the Devils head-plot muſt be broken.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Scripture cited in the Dialogue, is in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 21. Chriſt told his Diſciples, that he <hi>muſt go to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and ſuffer many things of the Elders, and Chief Prieſts, and Scribes, and be killed, and raiſed again the third day.</hi>

                     <hi>Reply</hi> 2. If <hi>Mathew</hi> had known that ſuch a Tenent would have been broached, he would doubtleſſe (if the Spirit of God had permitted) have ſhewed, that he muſt not have ſuffered the wrath of God; but it had been for Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> honor, if he could have ſhewed, that Chriſt told his Diſciples, <hi>That bee muſt go to Jeruſalem to ſuffer many things there</hi> from the immediate wrath of God, as well as from Sathans inſtruments, and then the Reader might have been ſatisfied.</p>

In the two former Scriptures he could not find any particle for the proving that Chriſt ſuffered divine Juſtice; but now in <hi>Luke</hi> 24, 26. he finds it in the word <hi>All,</hi> and yet there is no <hi>All</hi> in that verſe. Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> will rather coyn Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>words, than want a proof of Chriſts ſuffering from Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate wrath.</p>

                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:64895:99"/>
                     <hi>Reply</hi> 2. I deny that the death of Chriſt, namely, the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his ſoul from his body, was a proper penal death; for <note place="margin">The death of Chriſt could not be a penal death, becauſe Gods Law threatens none with a penal death but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. In his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon places part 2. p. 244.</note> the Law of God threatens no man with a penal death, nor yet with any other true curſe, but ſinners themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Sin and Death (ſaith <hi>Peter Martyr)</hi> is compared as cauſe and effect; But (ſaith he) here we muſt exempt Chriſt only, who notwithſtanding he knew no ſin, yet for our ſakes he dyed; But (ſaith he) Death had no dominion over him, becauſe he of his own accord, did ſuffer it for our ſalvation. The like ſpeech of his, I have cited in page 54.</p>
                  <p>Had not Chriſt dyed voluntarily, ſaith <hi>Bernard (ad milites Templi, cap.</hi> 11.) that death had not been meritorious; how much more unworthily he dyed who deſerved not death, ſo much more juſtly (man) liveth for whom he dyed; what juſtice, thou wilt ask, is this, that an innocent ſhould dye for a malefactor? It is no juſtice, it is mercy; If it were juſtice, then ſhould he not dye freely, but indebted thereto, and if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted, then indeed he ſhould dye, but the other for whom he dyed, ſhould not live; yet though it be not juſtice, it is not againſt juſtice, otherwiſe he could not be both juſt and merciful.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Teſtimonies of the Orthodox (and more to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I might bring) do point-blank oppoſe Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> Tenent, that Chriſts death was inflicted on him from Gods penal juſtice, through the meritorious cauſe of ſin, as our death is on us. But it is no ſuch matter, Chriſts death is of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <note place="margin">The true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſts death was to be a ſacrifice.</note> becauſe he undertook it from the voluntary Cauſe and Covenant onely, upon condition of meriting the deſtruction of Satans Head-plot, and the redeeming of all the Elect thereby; and in this reſpect his obedience, in giving his life, was covenanted to be accepted by the Father as a free gift, and as the richeſt Preſent that the world could afford; namely, as a ſacrifice of Attonement or Reconciliation, ſmelling like a moſt ſweet ſavor in the noſtrils of God; and in this reſpect his death is the ground of merit; but had it been inflicted on him from Gods penal wrath, as deſerved, through the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of ſin, it had merited nothing, as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks above.</p>

                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:64895:100"/>
When conditions are made by a voluntary Covenant for the winning or meriting of a rich prize, he that will ſtrive for the maſtery, with his oppoſite Champion, for the winning of the ſaid Prize, muſt ſtrive lawfully, that is to ſay, in obedience to thoſe Laws; and he muſt be willing to undergo all the hardſhips that he muſt meet withall from his oppoſite Champion; it may be, to the forcing of his body into an Agony, it may be, to the breaking of his body, and to the ſhedding of much blood; all this he muſt do from the voluntary cauſe &amp; from the voluntary Covenant; for the Maſters of the Game do not compel any man to undertake theſe difficult ſervices, neither do they out of anger and wrath inflict any of the ſaid puniſhments, though the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite party may happily do what he can in anger to pervert the Combaters obedience, and to provoke him to ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage, againſt the Laws of the prize, that ſo he may not win the prize from him: Even ſo Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>the author and finiſher of our Faith, for the joy that was ſet before him, indured the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is now ſet down</hi> (as a Victor over Satan, and all his potent Inſtruments) <hi>at the right hand of God,</hi> having firſt endured the croſs, and the contradiction of ſinners; and hath ſpoyled Principalities and Powers in it, namely, in his death on the croſs, which by Gods appointment did ſtrive for the maſtery with him, and the Devil did in anger provoke him what he could, to ſpoil his obedience, and ſo to hinder him from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying his head-plot, and ſo from winning the prize, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from the ſalvation of the Elect; and the Devil proceeded ſo far in his rage, that he peirced him in the foot-ſoals for a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Malefactor.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things I bring to exemplifie my meaning, that the death of Chriſt was not a proper penal death inflicted from the wrath of God, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth make it to be in his diſtribution: But it was a death agreed on by the voluntary Covenant, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">A deſcription of Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> reſpect unto the curſe accidentally; becauſe his Combater Satan had a commiſſion from God to do his worſt to make him a ſinner, and ſo to uſe him as a Malefactor, by putting him to an ignominious and curſed death, and ſo to diſturb his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence if he could: but becauſe Chriſt continued conſtant in his obedience, therefore he merited the redemption of all the Elect, from the curſe of the Law. And this is a true deſcription of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64895:100"/>
whereby God made himſelf a debtor to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But to affirm that the death of Chriſt did proceed from Gods penal curſe, as an effect from the cauſe (as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> affirms) doth utterly deſtroy the merit of his death and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaid above, and as you may ſee further in Ch. 12. at Reply 17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is appointed</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>unto men once to die, Heb.</hi> 9. 27, 28. This bodily death was not appointed till after <hi>Adams</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 27, 28</note> for his converſion is ſet out in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily death was not threatned till four verſes after, namely, in verſe 19. This appointment was for mankind that were guilty of original ſin, and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>it is appointed unto men once to die,</hi> namely, to men that were guilty of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin; but the Apoſtle doth not ſay in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27. that it was appointed for Chriſt to die by that ſentence; but he varies that phraſe when he comes to ſpeak of the death of Chriſt, and ſaith, <hi>So Chriſt was offered to bear the ſins of the many,</hi> thereby ſhewing, that the nature of his death was to be a ſacrifice, and ſo to be of a differing nature from our compulſory death, and that the end of it was to bear away the ſins of the many, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Gods free pardon and forgiveneſs by his death and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
                  <p>So then I may well conclude, That as Chriſts begetting was not like our begetting, ſo his death, in the formality of it, was not like our death; for though he ſuffered as a malefactor in his combating with Satan and his Inſtruments from the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Cauſe and Covenant; ſo alſo in the point of ſeparating his ſoul from his body, he did it as a Mediator, by his own Prieſtly power, and not by Satans power, as I ſhall ſhew, God willing, more at large hereafter, in my Reply to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 1. and to <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 46.</p>
                  <p>2 I come now to ſpeak to the ſecond part of his diſtribution of death to the ſoul of Chriſt, by ſeparating it from the ſenſe of the good things in the promiſe, and by inflicting the evill things in the commination. But this I have already denied, and given my Reaſons, in Chap. 2. Sect. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> and in Chap 4. And therefore now I will onely propound three Queſtions to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the learned, for the further clearing of this point.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 1. Whereas Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> in p. 21, makes death in ſin, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64895:101"/>
death for ſin, in their ſeveral branches (together with the evil of affliction) to flow from the commination in <hi>Gen. 2. 17.</hi> (as an effect from the cauſe) as the proper wages of <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſin, <hi>Rom. 5. 21.</hi> and 6. 23.</p>
                  <p>My firſt Queſtion from hence is this, Whether Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> be not all this while to be underſtood, as ſpeaking of ſin, and the curſe thereof, as it is to be conſidered <hi>de jure,</hi> namely, of the due deſert of ſin?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whereas he doth apply the ſeveral branches of his death, to ſeveral ſorts of perſons, ſome to the Reprobates, and ſome to the Elect, in differing reſpects; Whether he be not to be underſtood as ſpeaking of ſin, and the curſe thereof, as it is to be conſidered <hi>de facto,</hi> namely, in the event, and as it fell out to be executed, and that in a various manner; namely one way on the Elect, and another way on the Reprobate?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. In judging what kind of death is eſſential to <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, as naturally flowing from the curſe, as an effect from the cauſe; Whether is it more ſuitable to look at ſin and the curſe thereof, as it is to be conſidered <hi>de jure,</hi> or as it is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>de facto,</hi> or as it is both ways to be conſidered, ſeeing the curſe, <hi>de facto,</hi> in relation to the Elect, was altered by the Goſpel interceding?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. In conſidering the ſeveral branches of death, which of them are eſſential (and flowing naturally either from <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſin, or from our Original ſin) as a proper Effect from the Cauſe, and which of them are accidental, not flowing from ſin as ſin, (as Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> diſtribution ſpeaketh) but rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally, by means of ſome other thing.</p>
                  <p>If theſe Queſtions were rightly reſolved, and rightly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the points in agitation, the difficulties of this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie would be much eaſier. And I conceive my expoſition of the nature of the death threatned in <hi>Gen. 2. 17.</hi> as I have explained it in Chap. 2.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Therefore I deny that this Text did intend dying in the perſon of the man Chriſt Jeſus our Surety, for then he muſt have died our death in ſin; But his death was wholly founded in another Covenant, namely, in the voluntary Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as I have often ſaid before.</p>

                        <hi>Reply 5.</hi> I would fain know, why this reſervation of Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is mentioned; It ſeems, it is for this purpoſe, to hook in <note place="margin">Chriſt was not in the ſame obligation with <hi>Adam,</hi> as his Surety to the firſt Covenant</note> Chriſt as a Surety within the compaſs of this Text, and ſo to make the curſe contained in it due to him, as it appears both by his anſwer to his fourth Query in p. 6. (which hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready examined) and alſo by his daring expreſſions in p. 25. If Chriſt, ſaith he, be not within the compaſs of this Text, then the Text is not true; and a little after, Becauſe elect ſinners, not dying in their own perſons, muſt die in their Surety, or elſe the Text is not a truth. Modeſty would rather have ſaid, or elſe the Text is not truly expounded.</p>
                     <p>2 Had Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſaid thus, This Text is Gods judicial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unciation of ſin, (and ſo had wholly left out his reſervation of the execution of the execution of it) I ſhould have aſſented to him.</p>
                     <p>3 Take the commination for the preſent event of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, <note place="margin">As Gen: 2. 17. reſpects eternal death; ſo it ſpeaks rather of the deſert of ſin, than of the event.</note> and then it was the preſent death of the nature of all mankind in ſin; but take the commination as it reſpected eternal death, (as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> takes it) then it ſpeaks onely of the deſert of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> ſin, and not of the event to <hi>Adam</hi> and his elect poſterity; for he was delivered from the event, by the interpoſition of the promiſed ſeed, and ſo God was pleaſed to alter the event of the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:64895:102"/>
commination of the firſt Covenant, by his grace declared in the new Covenant, in <hi>Gen. 3. 15.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4 This reaſon makes it evident, that this Text hath not any ſuch reſervation (as above mentioned) Becauſe the commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Text muſt accord with other the like comminations, which do limit the curſe threatned, to the ſame numerical and individual perſons that are inherent and formal ſinners, as in <hi>Deut. 27. 26. Gal. 3. 10. Ezek. 18. 4.</hi> Therefore to aſſert the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of Hell torments from this Text, by one that never was a ſinner inherently, would have been held a paradox in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to our fore-fathers; and to affirm that Chriſt ſuffered the ſecond death, from this Text, that never was guilty of the firſt death, never dead in ſin, can be no leſs I think than a monſter in Religion.</p>
                     <p>5 This reaſon alſo makes it evident that the firſt Covenant <note place="margin">Though the firſt Covenant be ſuppoſed to be made in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Adams obedience or diſobedience to the moral Law of nature, yet in that ſenſe it is not a compleat Rule of rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Juſtice</note> could not contain a compleat rule of Gods relative Juſtice (yea though it be granted, that it was made in relation to <hi>Adams</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience or diſobedience to the moral Law of Nature,) becauſe it neither takes in the ſins againſt the Goſpel, nor yet the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor the rewards of it, theſe are ſupplied by the Goſpel in the Covenant of Grace; God did add what his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was to add, when he publiſhed the Goſpel, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in <hi>Gen. 3. 15.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6 This commination in <hi>Gen. 2. 17.</hi> doth hold all the Elect as well as the Reprobate alike guilty of the death there threatned, in caſe <hi>Adam</hi> diſobeyed by eating the forbidden fruit. Or thus, both the Elect and the Reprobate are alike guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and therefore they are alike under the guilt of original ſin, <hi>Rom. 3. 19, 20.</hi> therefore <hi>de jure,</hi> they are both alike under the ſame curſe, though after a while, the Elect, <hi>de facto</hi> are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the curſe of eternal death by means of the promiſe of Chriſt intervening, <hi>Gen. 3. 15. Rom 8. 1. Gal. 3. 13. Col. 2. 14.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2 Hence it follows, that in caſe this commination doth ſpeak of eternal death, then it ſpeaks of the deſert, rather than of the event, of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin in relation to the Elect.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, Either ſtrictly, for the glad tidings of ſalvation one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                     <p>Or ſecondly, More largely, not only for the glad tidings of

ſalvation, but alſo as comprehending other appurtenances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that Covenant, as Ceremonies or Seals, and ſo in caſe of neglect, or contempt, puniſhments; In the firſt ſenſe the threatning of Damnation is no part of the Goſpel; but in the ſecond ſenſe it is.</p>
                     <p>Now ſeeing Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> ſcope in this Inſtance, is to make good his anſwer to the Dialogue, namely, that though Chriſt doth not fall within the compaſſe of the Covenant of works, yet that he was contained within the compaſſe of that Text that ſpeaks of the firſt Covenant of works; even as Damnation, though it be no part of the Goſpel, yet is it contained within the compaſſe of that verſe which reveals the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>I ſay, the ſcope of this Inſtance being brought to make good that Anſwer; The judicious Reader will eaſily ſee that this Inſtance hath not truth in it, and therefore he hath not as yet proved, that Chriſt was contained within that Text of <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
                     <p>But ſtill Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſtrives to make it good, <hi>That Chriſt was comprehended within the compaſſe of that Text;</hi> for ſaith he, in page 24, 25. <hi>Adam in his eating intended and prohibited, was a figure of Chriſt to come,</hi> Rom. 5. 14. <note place="margin">Rom. 5, 14.</note>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply</hi> 3. Not properly in his eating intended and prohibited; But in the effects that followed his eating prohibited; the typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Reſemblance that is between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> lyes only in ſome general things, as thus; <hi>Adam</hi> was the head of that Covenant, which God made with him concerning the nature of all mankind, and ſo Chriſt was the head of the Covenant of grace, which God made with him concerning the Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the nature of all the Elect; <hi>Adam</hi> by his diſobedience merited a corrupt nature to all his poſterity, and Chriſt by his obedience even to death, merited a ſanctified nature to all his elect ſeed. The Reader may fetch the parallel from <hi>P. Martyr,</hi> Dr. <hi>Willet,</hi> and others, on <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 19.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what is the inference that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> makes? namely, <hi>That Chriſt is contained within the compaſſe of this Text.</hi> I ſay, it follows not; for though there may be a reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the firſt and ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> in many other things, yet not
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64895:104"/>
in all things, and therefore in ſome things <hi>Adam</hi> was no figure of Chriſt: as for example, He was no figure of Chriſt in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eſſential Curſe. And that is the point which Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth aim at in this Text.
<q>
                           <p>But ſaith Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> in page 25. <hi>It is certain (though</hi> Adam <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the first Covenant perceived it not) that Chriſt was couched and comprehended in ſome part of the revealed will of God, during the firſt Covenant; It is very probable,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>That the Tree of life in</hi> Gen. 2. 9. <hi>was a figure of Christ, who is called, and indeed is, the Tree of life,</hi> Rev. 22. 2. <hi>And,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>If Christ be not within the compaſſe of the Text, the Text is not true.</hi>

                        <hi>Reply.</hi> 4. We may ſoon loſe our ſelves in this diſpute, if wee keep not cloſe to the point of the Dialogue in hand, which Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> labors to confute.</p>
                     <p>The Dialogue ſaith, this text of <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. doth not include Chriſt within the compaſſe of it, as liable to the death there threatned: But Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> cites another text to prove it, namely <hi>Gen</hi> 2. 9. and yet he affirmed that Chriſt was within the compaſſe of this text of <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. namely as the Surety of the Elect, and that thereby he was made liable to ſuffer the death there threatned; for ſaith he, <hi>Man ſins, and man dyes</hi> (by vertue of this Text) <hi>either in his own perſon, or in the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But how doth all this that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> hath ſaid, ſuit to the point in hand? and how doth it tend to diſprove what the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue affirms?</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Saith he, <hi>It is certain, that Chriſt was couched in this Text;</hi> but in his proof he only ſaith, <hi>It is very probable that the Tree of life, &amp;c.</hi> in his Propoſition he affirmeth, <hi>It is certain;</hi> but in his proof he ſaith, <hi>It is no more but probable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But let his words be a little further examined; <hi>Where is Chriſt couched?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1 One while he tells us, That he is couched, and intended in ſome part of the revealed will of God, during the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Another while he tells us, That it is probable that the Tree of life in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 9. was a figure of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Another time he ſaith, That Chriſt muſt be within the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64895:104"/>
compaſſe of this Text of <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. or elſe the Text is not true.</p>
                     <p>All theſe three conſiderations laid together, do prove that Chriſt is contained ſomewhere, or no where, in ſome Text, or in no Text.</p>
                     <p>And now let the judicious Reader judge what his Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his Proof doth amount to.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Examine his Diſcourſe a little further; The Dialogue affirmeth, that Chriſt falls not within the compaſſe of this Text in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
                     <p>The Dialogue doth not meddle whether Chriſt was couched in any other Text.</p>
                     <p>2 The Dialogue denies that Chriſt was not within this text as liable to the death there threatned. Now then let it bee ſuppoſed that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> could produce ſome other text, during the firſt Covenant, wherein Chriſt was included or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured: Suppoſe the Tree of life was a figure of him, though it be denied both by Mr. <hi>Shepherd,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burges,</hi> and others, as I have noted in Chap. 2. yet except he can prove that Chriſt was comprehended in this text, and that hee was thereby liable to the death there threatned, he doth but labor to no purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>3 Examine his arguing a little further: The Dialogue contends that Chriſt is not contained in the word <hi>Thou; Thou ſhalt ſurely dye. Thou</hi> Adam <hi>in thine own perſon; and thou</hi> Adam <hi>in thy Poſterity</hi> (ſaith the Dialogue) <hi>But not thou in thy Surety ſhalt dye;</hi> The word <hi>Thou ſhalt dye,</hi> intends no more but the perſon or perſons with whom the firſt Covenant was made.</p>
                     <p>But let us conſider the Argument that doth ariſe from Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> own words; And it may be framed thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Chriſt falls not within the compaſſe of the firſt Covenant of works,</hi> faith Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> in page 24.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But thou ſhalt dye</hi> (intending thereby the perſons with whom the firſt Covenant was made) <hi>falls within the compaſs of the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> as he affirmeth in his ſecond Propoſition.</p>
                     <p>Therefore Chriſt falls not within the firſt Covenant of works, becauſe the word <hi>Thou,</hi> intends the perſons only with whom the firſt Covenant was made.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="156" facs="tcp:64895:105"/>
And thus you ſee how Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> hath confuted himſelf, by proving that Chriſt was not comprehended within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17.</p>

                  <p>2 Gods reſolution is often hypothetical or conditional, and therefore we may pray for thoſe things that ſeem contrary to his revealed will, <hi>Ezek. 3. 17. 21. Amos</hi> 4. 12.</p>
                  <p>3 God doth often change his Comminations, for our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>Gen. 19. 21. Job. 3. 10.

                  <p>4 God doth often ſeem to will thoſe things that indeed hee willeth not, only to prove us, <hi>Mat. 15. 23, 24, 26. Luke 24. 28. Exod. 32. 10. Numb.</hi> 14, 10.</p>

                     <hi>Reply</hi> 7. I Have ſhewed in Chap. 2. Sect. 1. That the true nature of the firſt Covenant ſtood not in <hi>Adams</hi> obedience or diſobedience to the moral Law of nature, but in relation to a <note place="margin">Gods poſitive Laws were not engraven in <hi>Adams</hi> nature, as his moral Law was.</note> poſitive Law about things indifferent in their own nature, as the eating of the two Trees was; for Gods poſitive Laws were not ingraven in <hi>Adams</hi> nature, but reſerved in Gods ſecret De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crec to be impoſed on man, for an act, or acts, for a time, as hee pleaſed to appoint, and then to be annihilated again.</p>
                  <p>I grant, that the moral Law of nature did direct <hi>Adam</hi> to obey God in whatſoever poſitives he ſhould appoint: But yet by the Law of nature, he knew not any of Gods poſitives, till they were particularly revealed; neither can man, without a ſpecial revelation, know the reaſon of them, becauſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended only on the good pleaſure of God, and therefore <hi>Adams</hi> moral perfections could not prevent, but that the Devil might deceive him about the reaſon of poſitives, as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chap. 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:64895:107"/>
2 I do not remember (and I pray let the Judicious conſider it) that eternal death is directly threatned for the breach of any outward poſitive Law, but at the firſt death in ſin, and ever after a bodily death (but eternal death is often directly threatned for Unbele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f and Rebellion againſt the Law of Grace) and therefore the threatning in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. may bee exempted from that threatning, though not from death in ſin.</p>
                  <p>3 Let it bee ſuppoſed, that the firſt Covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> was made in relation to the moral Law (which is denied, and cannot be granted) yet it is evident, that God doth ſomtimes alter from <note place="margin">See <hi>P Martyr</hi> in Com. pl. par. 1. pag 190.</note> that Law; for he commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to kill his only ſon, which was contray to the ſixth Commandement, and hee commanded the Iſraelites to ſpoyl the Egyptians of their goods, <hi>Exod.</hi> 11. 2. and Chriſt bid the Impotent man, when he was healed, to carry his bed on his back on the Sabbath day.</p>
                  <p>Theſe examples ſhew, that God is not tyed to his revealed moral Laws, as wee are, but that he hath a ſupreme power to, alter from that Rule to his ſecret Decree; but when God is <note place="margin">God doth ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alter from the rule of his moral Commands, to his ſecret De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</note> pleaſed to bind his promiſes or threatnings by an oath, then we may be ſure his will ſo revealed is unalterable, becauſe his oath doth alwayes declare what his ſecret Will and Decree is; And hence it comes to paſſe, that his word and command which he delivers to us for our rule, is many times alterable, becauſe it is many times differing from his ſecret Decree. And hence it is, that when his threatnings are annexed to his Laws, it is to ſhew unto man what his ſin deſerves, but not what God will certainly execute; for it is his good pleaſure ſometimes to Relax his threatning, which is a forgiveneſſe of temporal plagues, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 38. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 13, 14. for as there are two ſorts of puniſhments threatned, ſo there are two ſorts of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <note place="margin">Iſal. 78 38.</note> one in relation to temporary, and the other in relation to eternal puniſhment, and ſo in like ſort there are two ſorts of juſtification.</p>
                  <p>4 This ſentence (as it relates to eternal death) in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. <note place="margin">In the Right way of dying well.</note> ſaith <hi>Perkins,</hi> muſt be underſtood with an exception borrowed from the Goſpel, or Covenant of Grace, revealed to <hi>Adam</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after his fall: The exception goes thus, <hi>Thou ſhalt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly

                  <p>And ſaith <hi>Baxter,</hi> How can it ſtand with the truth and juſtice of God, to diſpence with his threatnings? he anſwers thus to <note place="margin">In his <hi>Aphora</hi> p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And to this ſenſe ſaith another learned Divine: The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. is like to ſome other of Gods threats againſt the Tranſgreſſors of his Law; but it bindeth not God that he ſhall have power to releaſe or mitigate, what, and to whom it pleaſeth him.</p>
                  <p>The Elect are called the children of wrath as well as others; <note place="margin">
                        <hi>De Recenſ. peccatoris, par. 1 c.</hi> 1.</note> But ſaith Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> It may bee anſwered, that the Holy Ghoſt in theſe, and ſuch like places of Scripture doth ſignifie what is due to ſin, and ſinners, and what their eſtate muſt needs bee in their own apprehenſions (if they will judge of themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the light of true reaſon: for there is in ſin a certain naughtineſs for which it juſtly may bee, and indeed is odious unto God) but it will not follow thereupon, that he ceaſeth to love them, <hi>Whom he hath predeſtinate unto the adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 1. 5.</p>
                  <p>All theſe Inſtances do evidence, that Gods threatnings in the event are often alterable, and therefore that his threatning of eternal death in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. (in caſe it be there threatned) is alterable, and doth not bind God, neither to leave the Elect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of their ſpiritual death in ſin, nor yet to inflict eternal death, neither on the Elect, nor on their Surety; and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:64895:108"/>
therefore according to the liberty of his eternal Will and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, hee ordained that the conlfict of Chriſt with Sathan, in continuing obedient to the death of the Croſſe, and at laſt making his ſoul a ſacrifice, ſhould be a valuable conſideration, whereion hee would diſpence with the rigor of his commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo let fall, or ſuſpend, the pnealty of eternal death, in caſe it had been the chief thing threatned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. as moſt do hold, and therefore for their ſakes I have cited theſe Inſtances, though ſtill I think my firſt expoſition of <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. is ſound and good, in Chap. 2.

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 1. He makes the Reader beleeve, that the ſcope of this Chapter doth ſpeak to this one point, namely, That Chriſt did <note place="margin">Chriſt carried our ſorrows &amp;c ſickneſſes away by his Divine power.</note> bear ſuch griefs and ſorrows as are due to us, which in other places he calls the Eſſential torments of Hell, and thence hee inſers that this ſpeech in verſe 4. <hi>He hath born our griefs, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried our ſorrows,</hi> doth intend ſo much; but a judicious Reader may eaſily ſee that the ſcope of this Chapter is to ſet out the operations of the divine nature, as well as of the humane, and of ſeveral other things that belong both to the Perſon and Office of Chriſt; and therefore the ſimple Reader may eaſily bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by telling them thus, That the Prophet in this Text, by griefs and ſorrows, intends ſuch ſufferings by Chriſt as are due to us, namely, Hell-ſorrows, as is plain from the Chapter</p>
                     <p>2 He tells the Reader that this ſenſe is plain, by comparing of the fourth and fifth verſes with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. and thus hee doth winde in the fourth verſe, with the fifth verſe, whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the fifth verſe only doth anſwer to 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. and ſo the Dialogue doth parallel it, and explain; and thus hee deceives both himſelf and the Reader, by joyning both theſe verſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one ſenſe, which in the Dialogue are handled aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in a differing ſenſe; and the Dialogue gives this evident reaſon for it, namely, becauſe the bearing away of our griefs in verſ. 4. is expounded by <hi>Matthew</hi> of his bearing away of our infirmities, and diſeaſes, by the power of his God-head; and to this very ſenſe <hi>Matthew</hi> doth tranſlate this verſe of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſaying, <hi>That it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by</hi> Iſaiah the Prophet, himſelf took our infirmities, and bare our ſickneſſes; and beſides, the Prophet himſelf doth confirm this ſenſe in the laſt clauſe of this fourth verſe, ſaying, <hi>Yet we did eſteem him ſtricken, ſmitten of God and afflicted.</hi> The Dialogue doth open this clauſe thus, Though the glory of his God-head did ſhine in our eyes, (by his miraculous bearing away of ſickneſſes and infirmities) yet we eſteemed him but as a groſſe Impoſtor, and therefore put him to death as a vild Malefactor, and then we judged him (that had done ſo many miraculous cures) to be ſtricken, ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:64895:109"/>
of God, and afflicted for his own deſerved faults. And thus the Reader may ſee the true ſenſe of this verſe to bee cleered by the context, as well as by <hi>Matthews</hi> tranſlation. But if his bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſorrows, had meant that he bare our Hell-ſorrows, then the laſt clauſe muſt have run thus, And wee did rightly judge that hee was plagued, and ſmitten of Gods wrath with Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorrows.</p>

                     <hi>Reply</hi> 2. BY this Expoſition of <hi>Naſa</hi> with <hi>Sabal,</hi> Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſhews himſelf to bee a greater Scholar than the Evangeliſt <hi>Matthew; For</hi> (ſaith he) Sabal <hi>ſignifieth properly to bear as one bears a burden; and therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this reſtraineth the ſenſe of the former word</hi> Naſa <hi>to the received interpretation;</hi> by this, hee tells the Reader, that <hi>Matthews</hi> interpretation is not the received interpretation, but that Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> interpretation is the received interpretation. They may receive it that pleaſe, <hi>The blind will eat many a flye,</hi> but I hope the Lord will help me to receive <hi>Matthews</hi> interpretation before it.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, If <hi>Sabal</hi> doth ſignifie properly to bear as one bears a burden, and doth reſtrain <hi>Naſa</hi> to the ſame ſenſe, then it follows, that either Chriſt took the infirmities from the ſick,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64895:109"/>
and bare them upon his own body, as a Porter bears a burden, or elſe that <hi>Matthew</hi> gives a wrong interpretation of <hi>Sabal:</hi> And thus Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> hath put himſelf into a <hi>Dilemma,</hi> and therefore now hee muſt either blame his own interpretation to juſtifie <hi>Matthew,</hi> or elſe he muſt ſtill blame <hi>Matthews</hi> interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Sabal</hi> to juſtifie his.</p>
                  <p>3 I conceive that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> had reaſoned more like a Scholar, if hee had ſaid, that though <hi>Sabal</hi> doth ordinarily ſignifie to carry as a Porter bears a burden, yet ſometimes, when it is joyned with <hi>Naſa,</hi> it may ſignifie lifting up, or bearing away, as <hi>Naſa</hi> doth uſually.

It is juſt with God, that he that keeps not cloſe to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, when hee doth expound the bleſſed Scriptures, eſpecially when the ſenſe is already made by conference of one Scripture with another, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is by the Holy Ghoſt in <hi>Matthew</hi> (which is a ſure rule of true Expoſition) that God ſhould leave them to wander after their own vain fantaſies.</p>
                  <p>Sentences of Scripture (ſaith <hi>Peter Martyr)</hi> muſt not bee more largely underſtood, than the place it ſelf wherein they are written may bear, for otherwiſe, ſaith he, Wee may bee ſoon lead into error, in his <hi>Com. pl. part. 1. pag.</hi> 208.</p>
                  <p>It is equally dangerous (ſaith another Reverend Divine) to add to the truth, and to take from it; yet (ſaith hee) men do more generally offend in adding to the truth, being naturally inclined to foſter thoſe brats which their own fantaſies have conceived and brought forth.</p>

All that he ſpeaks to this point, namely, That God is the univerſal efficient, is to little purpoſe, except it bee to blind the Reader, to make him beleeve that the Dialogue doth make the Devil to be the univerſal efficient without Gods appointment; but any one that pleaſeth to peruſe the Dialogue, may ſee, that it makes all Chriſts ſufferings to bee from Gods appointment, as the univerſal efficient: for the Dialogue propounds this Queſtion, <hi>Who did wound him, and bruiſe him?</hi> and then it makes this anſwer, <hi>It was Sathan by his Inſtruments,</hi> according to Gods Prediction in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. for God ſaid thus to Sathan, Thou Sathan ſhalt pierce him, thou Sathan ſhalt put the promiſed Seed to Death, as a wicked Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, by thy Inſtruments, the Scribes and Phariſees, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers; thou ſhalt peirce his hands and feet, by nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them to the Croſſe, according to the determinate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God, and in this reſpect God may bee ſaid to wound him.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre I have repeated the words of the Dialogue, and now I leave the judicious Reader to judge whether Maſter <hi>Norton</hi> had any juſt cauſe to except againſt the Dialogue, as if it did not make God to be the univerſal efficient in all Chriſts ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>The like flouriſh he makes againſt the Dialogue in other <note place="margin">Maſter <hi>Norton</hi> doth often wroug the ſenſe of the Dialogue</note> points, thereby labouring to make the ſimple Reader beleeve, That the Dialogue doth hold that which it doth abhor, as in <hi>Pſal,</hi> 103. 114. 130, &amp;c.

                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeemeth by Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> diſtribution of the Curſe, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. that he holds this for a firm concluſion, That all the outward afflictions of Chriſt were from Gods Vindicative wrath, and therefore he calls them the outward penal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell, as I formerly noted in Chap. 11.</p>
                  <p>But yet Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> in the ſame Page doth acknowledge, That <note place="margin">The true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all Chriſts grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Sufferings was Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called the Eſſential Torments of Hell from Gods vindicative wrath.</note> all the afflictions which God inflicteth upon the Elect from the ſame Curſe, are but Chaſtiſements, and not Vindicative puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſo that affliction of their flight into <hi>Aegypt</hi> was but a Chaſtiſement to <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> but it was a Vindicative puniſhment to Chriſt: But I would fain know a little more of Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> skill, how he can call the Afflictions and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which Chriſt ſuffered, Hell Torments from Gods Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative wrath, ſeeing the Holy Ghoſt doth comprehend them all under the word Chaſtiſement, in this very fifth Verſe? for the Prophet ſpeaks here of all the greateſt Sufferings of Chriſt, which he indured in that long action of his Paſſion, from his Apprehenſion to his Death, I ſay, all theſe ſufferings hee comprehends under the word Chaſtiſements; but it ſeems that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> hath an Art beyond the Holy Ghoſt to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from Chaſtiſements, and to rank them under Gods Vindicative Juſtice; let the Reader judge if he do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to be learned above the Holy Ghoſt in the ſenſe of the word Chaſtiſement.</p>
                  <p>The Learned obſerve that the Hebrew word <hi>Muſar,</hi> derived from <hi>Jaſar,</hi> doth properly ſignifie the correction of a Father towards his Son, as all theſe places do teſtifie, <hi>Prov. 3. 11, 12. Prov. 19. 18. Deut. 8. 5. Pſal. 94. 12. Jer.</hi> 31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18. and in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 6. <note place="margin">Heb, 5, 6</note> the Apoſtle doth concur with the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> That the true
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64895:112"/>
nature of all Chriſts Sufferings were but Chaſtiſements, for he ſaith thus, Though he were the Son, yet learned he obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by the things he ſuffered; his learning of obedience is the ſubjection of a Son to his Fathers chaſtiſement, and therefore it follows neceſſarily, That ſeeing all his Sufferings were but Chaſtiſements, they were not inflicted on him from Gods Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicative wrath, and I beleeve that this is a ſound truth, that will hold water if the Scripture hold.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is further evident that the Sufferings of Chriſt are farre from being inflicted on him from Gods Vindicative wrath; becauſe all his ſufferings, and all the ſufferings of the Saints are founded alike in Gods fatherly love, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect there is a reciprocal communion between Chriſt the Head and all his members, in all their ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>1 The Elect do partake with Chriſt in all his ſufferings, I mean in reſpect of the kinde of them, as theſe Scriptures do teſtifie, <hi>Phil. 3. 10, 11. 2 Tim. 2. 11. Col. 1. 24. 1 Pet. 4. 13. 1 Pet. 2. 21. Rom. 6. 2 Cor. 1. 5. Mar. 10. 39. Luk.</hi> 22. 28. and therefore hence it follows neceſſarily, that if the ſufferings of Chriſt were from Gods Vindicative wrath, that then all the ſufferings of the Elect muſt likewiſe be from Gods Vindicative wrath, ſeeing they do communicate with Chriſt in the kinde of his ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Theſe Scriptures do teſtifie that Chriſt the Head doth communicate with all his Members in all their ſufferings, <hi>Heb. 2. 18. Heb. 4. 15. Eſ, 63. 1, 2.</hi> And hence it doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow, that if all the Sufferings of the Members of Chriſt bee but Chaſtiſements, then the Sufferings of Chriſt muſt not be ranked in any other form of Juſtice but where Gods Chaſtiſements are.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is evident, that all the Sufferings of Chriſt are called but temptations of Trial, <hi>Heb. 2. 18. Heb.</hi> 4. 15. and Chriſt himſelf at the upſhot of his life doth call all his former Afflictions but ſuch temptations of Trial, wherein his Apoſtles had been ſharers with him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 28. and therefore it doth hence follow, that they were not inflicted on him from Gods Vindicative wrath, unleſſe M. <hi>Norton</hi> wil prove that the Apoſtles alſo did ſuffer Gods Vindicative wrath, which in another place he ſeems to deny.</p>

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64895:114"/>
nature had been a true part of his divine perſon, as our ſouls are of our perſons, then it muſt have holpen his humane nature to bear his ſorrows; but I think it is no leſſe than he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie to hold ſo; but becauſe it was but an Appendix to his divine perſon, therefore the divine nature could put out his power to leave the humane nature to its ſelf, and to its own qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to bee touched to the utmoſt with the ſenſible feeling of our infirmities; and therefore I ſay, That the perfections of his humane nature, and the unction of the holy Spirit at his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalment was ſufficient to ſupport him, and to regulate his ſoul-ſorrows, without the co-operation of his divine nature; and doubtleſſe, as his humane nature was moſt perfect in ſpirits, ſo it was to the utmoſt touched with the ſenſe of our infirmities, much more then our corrupt natures can bee. But I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more of this in the Paſſion of Chriſt; and in reſpect of his ineffable union, his divine nature did leave his humane nature to act in his moral obedience, and natural actions.</p>

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 12. The way of juſtice is either the way of vindicative juſtice, or elſe it is the way of juſtice according to the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Covenant. The Dialogue indeed doth oppoſe the way of <note place="margin">The true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of merit, and how Chriſt did merit our Redemption.</note> vindicative juſtice; but yet it makes all Chriſts ſufferings to be performed in a way of juſtice, according to the order of juſtice in the voluntary Cauſe and Covenant; but it is no marvel that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> cannot ſee into this ground-word of merit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is ſo much prejudiced againſt the Dialogue ſcope, or elſe he could not have ſaid, that it affirms a contradiction: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I ſhould have affirmed a contradictioni, f I had at any time affirmed as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth, that the meritorious cauſe of all Chriſts ſufferings and death, was from Gods judicial impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our ſins to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>But the Dialogue goes another way to work, it ſhews from Gods declaration in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. That the Devil muſt combate againſt the ſeed of the deceived woman, and that Chriſt in his humane nature, muſt combate againſt him, and break his Head-plot, by continuing obedient to the death, and that therefore his ſufferings and death were meritorious, becauſe it was all performed in a way of juſtice, namely, in exact obedience to all the Articles of the voluntary Covenant, as I have ſhewed alſo in Chap. 10.</p>
                     <p>And it is out of all doubt that the Articles of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Covenant for mans Redemption are compriſed in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of our Redemption in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
                     <p>1 God doth there declare by way of threatning to Sathan (doubtleſſe in the hearing of <hi>Adam,</hi> and for his inſtruction) that he would put an enmity between him and the woman, and between the devils ſeed and her ſeed (hee ſhall enter the Liſts, and try Maſteries with thee) and hee ſhall break thy Head-plot (and to this conflict doth the word Agony agree
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64895:115"/>
in <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 44.) And Thou Sathan ſhalt bear an utter enmity againſt him; and thou ſhalt have liberty to enter the Liſts with this ſeed of the deceived woman, and have liberty to do what thou canſt to pervert his obedience, as thou haddeſt to pervert the obedience of <hi>Adam,</hi> and in caſe thou canſt diſturb his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience by ignominious contumelies, or by the torture of a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful death, and ſo pervert him in his obedience, then thou ſhalt by that means hinder this ſeed of the woman from making his ſoul a ſacrifice, and ſo from the breaking of thy Head-plot, and ſo from winning the prize, and therefore thou ſhalt have free liberty to tempt him to ſin as much as thou canſt, and thou ſhalt have liberty to impute as many ſinful crimes againſt him as thou canſt deviſe, and ſo to put him to an ignominious and painful death, like to wicked male factors.</p>
                     <p>But in caſe he ſhall continue patient without diſturbance, and continue obedient to the death, without any diverſion, and at laſt make his death an obedient ſacrifice by his own Prieſtly power, then I will accept his death and ſacrifice as full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the ſins of the Elect, and ſo hee ſhall break thy Head-plot, and win the prize, which is the ſalvation of all the Elect; and doubtleſs this death and ſacrifice of Chriſt was exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to <hi>Adam</hi> by the ſacrifice of ſome Lamb, preſently after his Fall.</p>
                     <p>Lo, here is a true deſcription of Chriſts merit, according to the order of juſtice, as it was agreed on, in the voluntary Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; For wee may gather from the threatning, Firſt, That there was ſuch a voluntary Covenant. Secondly, That Chriſt did covenant to continue conſtant in his obedience through all his temptations and trials. And thirdly, that upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof, God would reward him with the ſalvation of all the Elect, <hi>Pbi.</hi> 2. 9, 10, 11. <hi>Eſ.</hi> 53 10 &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Wotton De Reconciliatione peccatoris, part. 1. cap. 4.</hi> doth thus explain the meritorious cauſe.</p>
                     <p>That the meritorious cauſe of Reconciliation (ſaith hee) is a kind of efficient, there needs no other proof, then that it binds as it were the principal efficient, to perform that which upon the merit is due; As if a man in running a race, or the like, ſo runneth as the order of the Game requireth, by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hee meriteth the prize or reward, and thereby alſo hee
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64895:116"/>
bindeth the Maſter of the Game to pay him that which he hath deſerved.</p>
                     <p>This is a true deſcription of the true nature of Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit according to the order of juſtice, in the voluntary Covenant, better and more agreeable to the Scripture than Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> is from the legal order of Court-juſtice, by a legal imputation of ſin; for the Scripture is ſilent in this way, and plain in the other way.</p>
                     <p>And from this deſcription of merit from the voluntary cauſe and Covenant, Theſe Concluſions do follow.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That the wounds, bruiſes, and blood-ſhed of ſuch as did win the prize, cannot be ſaid to be inflicted upon them from the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicative wrath of the Maſters of the Game, cauſed through the imputation of ſin, and guilt againſt their Laws; for none can win the prize that is guilty of any ſuch tranſgreſſion againſt their Law, as the Apoſtle doth witneſſe in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. and peruſe alſo Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> Annotations on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 24. and on <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1, 2. <note place="margin">Imputation of ſin in the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate doth loſe the prize.</note> and on 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 8. and take notice, that the Greek in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7. is the ſame by which the Seventy tranſlate <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 8. <hi>With ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wraſtlings have I wraſtled,</hi> namely, for the maſtery and victory; and ſo alſo our larger Annotations on 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Hence it follows, That the ſaid wounds, bruiſes, and blood ſhed, ought not to bee accounted as any vindicative <note place="margin">Puniſhments may be ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without the imputation of ſin.</note> puniſhments from the Maſters of the prize, but as voluntary trials of their man-hood, of their patience, and obedience to their Laws.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Hence it follows, That the wounds and bruiſes mentioned in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 5. 10. &amp;c. which Chriſt ſuffered, were no other but the very ſame that God had declared hee ſhould ſuffer from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, <note place="margin">God did wound and bruiſe Chriſt no otherwiſe, but as h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Job</hi> did acknowledge, when the Devil deſtroyed his cattel and children, that it was the Lord that took theſe things from him, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 21. and ſaith, when the Devil ſmote him full of boyls, <hi>The band of the Lord hath touched me,</hi> Job 19. 1. and yet it was Sathan that did ſmite him with boyls, <hi>Job</hi> 2. 7. So God is ſaid by <hi>Iſaiah, To delight to bruiſe Chriſt, and to put him to grief,</hi> becauſe God delivered Chriſt into the hands of the Devils Inſtruments to combate for the victory, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 23. and ſo it is ſaid, <hi>That God ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all,</hi> namely, to Sathan and his Inſtruments to combate with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. And ſo in like ſort, God is ſaid, <hi>To give power to</hi> Pilate <hi>to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 19. 11. And ſo God delivered him into the hands of ſinners, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 45. to do unto him whatſoever the council of God had determined, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 28. And his Father gave him the cup of all theſe afflictions, <hi>Job.</hi> 18. 11. becauſe hee declared that Sathan ſhould have this liberty and power, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
                     <p>Yea Chriſt delivered himſelf into the hands of ſinners, <hi>Job.</hi> 18. 4. 8. And Chriſt did often foretel his ſufferings to his Diſciples, ſaying, <hi>Behold wee go up to Jeruſalem, and the Son of man ſhall be delivered unto the chief Prieſts, and unto the Scribes, and they ſhall condemn him unto death, and ſhall deliver him unto the Gentiles, and they ſhall mock him, and ſcourge him, and ſpit upon him, and ſhall kill him, Mat. 16. 21. Mar. 10. 33, 34. Luke 18. 31, 32, 33. Luke 24. 7. 25, 26, 44, 46. Act. 13. 27, 28, 29.</hi> And all this Chriſt did undergo from the voluntary Cauſe and Covenant, as it was declared in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and therefore not from Gods wrath.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 This doth cleerly exemplifie, how, and in what reſpect the obedience of Chriſt in all his ſufferings was merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 14. Though it bee unſound in Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> ſenſe, yet it is not unſound in the Scripture ſenſe; let the former Scripture in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. be judge in the caſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 He muſt dye as a Malefactor, for God had armed Sathan with authority to uſe him as a vild Malefactor, and to crucifie him in the Foot-ſoals.</p>
                     <p>And yet 2 As ſoon as Chriſt had finiſhed all thoſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in obedience to the Laws of the combate, he muſt make his ſoul a ſacrifice of Reconciliation (taught by the death of ſome Lamb) by his Prieſtly power, even by the joynt concurrence of both his natures, or elſe he could not have been the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the New Teſtament, through death, if hee had not (as ſoon as hee had finiſhed all his ſufferings) offered his vital ſoul for a ſacrifice by his eternal Spirit; both his natures did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:64895:117"/>
to make his death a ſacrifice, and in that reſpect only hee was the Mediator of the New Teſtament through that kind of death; As the Apoſtles argument lyes in <hi>Heb,</hi> 9. 14, 15, 16. And thus the Dialogue doth make the notions of a Malefactor, and a Mediator, to bee cleerly diſtinct.</p>
                     <p>7 Hence it is evident that all the outward ſufferings of Chriſt, were from the voluntary Cauſe and Covenant in entring the Liſts with Sathan (not in the power of his God-head, but) in his humane nature which he received from the ſeed of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived woman, and as it was accompanied with our infirmities: And in this reſpect he is ſaid by <hi>Iſaiah, to be wounded or tormiented for our tranſgreſſions, and to bee bruiſed for our iniquities.</hi> And thus <hi>Peter</hi> muſt bee underſtood, when he ſaith, <hi>He bare our ſins in his body on the Tree;</hi> that is to ſay, Our puniſhments in his combate with Sathan, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. And thus Chriſt was oppreſſed by his <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 24.</note> Combater Sathan, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 7. when hee ſuffered himſelf to bee apprehended by a band of armed Souldiers, and to bee bound <note place="margin">Eſ. 53. 7.</note> as a priſoner, and as a Malefactor; and in this ſenſe Chriſt ſaith <hi>I am the good Shepherd that giveth his life for his ſheep,</hi> Joh. 10. 11. I will readily venture my life in the combate with that roaring Lion Sathan for the redemption of my ſheep; And thus <hi>Moſes</hi> did offer his life to redeem the lives of the Iſraelites when they had forfeited their lives into the hands of Gods juſtice, by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the Golden Calf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. <hi>Then</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid, I will now go up to the Lord, peradventure I ſhall make Attonement for your ſin; and be ſaid to God, If thou wilt forgive their ſin, and if not</hi> (but that they muſt ſtill dye) <hi>blot me I pray thee out of thy book which thou haſt written</hi> (called the Book of the living, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 69. 29. and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alſo the Writing of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Eze. 13. 9.) And herein <hi>Moſes</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ainſworth)</hi> dealt as a Mediator between God and men, and was a figure of our Mediator Chriſt, who laid down his life for his ſheep, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 15. and redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, when hee was made a curſe for us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. The intent of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſay the Hebrew Doctors was, That hee might dye inſtead of them, and bear their iniquity according to that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 5. <hi>He was wounded for our Treſpaſſes:</hi> For (ſay the Hebrew Doctors) The death of the juſt maketh Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation. <note place="margin">Ex. 32. 32.</note> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 32. But in caſe <hi>Moſes</hi> had been made guilty of their ſin by Gods imputation, doubtleſs hee
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64895:118"/>
had not been a fit perſon to offer his life as a Mediator for their lives. This reſemblance, I grant, is but very weak, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> did not offer to give his life as a Mediator for them, by a mutual Covenant, but of his own head, and therefore his offer was refuſed; yet that ſpeech of the Hebrew Doctors, The death of the juſt maketh Reconciliation, may ſomewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten touching that place in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. where it is ſaid, <hi>That</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>Christ ſuffered, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God;</hi> for hee being juſt in Gods ſight, ingaged himſelf, acording to a mutual and reciprocal Covenant, to enter the Liſts with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and to continue juſt through all the malicious deſigns of Sathan, even to the death of the Croſſe, that ſo at laſt hee might make his ſoul a ſacrifice of Attonement, and ſo bring us to God. Mark this, Hee is called the juſt in all his ſufferings: But hee was not ſo called in the Jews account, for they put him to death as a ſinful Malefactor. Neither could hee bee ſaid to be abſolutely juſt in the ſight of God, in caſe God had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the guilt of our ſins to him in a formal legal way: But ſaith <hi>Peter, The juſt ſuffered for the unjust,</hi> hee that knew himſelf to be every way juſt in the fight of God, and of his Law, hee entred the Liſts, and ſuffered from Sathans enmity, and yet ſtill he continued obedient to the death, and ſo continued to bee juſt. And hence wee may ſee wherein the efficacy of Chriſts <note place="margin">All Chriſts ſufferings were without any imputation of ſin from God, and therefore he was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo his obedience to the death doth bring us to God.</note> ſufferings do conſiſt, namely, in this, becauſe in all his conflict with Sathan, his patience was not diſturbed, nor his obedience perverted, but to the very laſt, hee approved himſelf to bee moſt juſt and righteous in the ſight of God, and therefore hee conquered Sathan by righteouſneſſe (as the ancient Divines do very often ſpeak) becauſe he ſtrove lawfully, according to the order agreed on by the voluntary Covenanters; And ſo hee won the prize.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 In his combate with Sathan, his obedience was eminent, above the obedience of any condemned delinquent that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently ſubmits his life to bee taken away by juſtice, becauſe hee put forth a voluntary act of compliance in all his combating with Sathan, and in all his ſufferings, that ſo hee might pleaſe him that had choſen him to bee the Captain of our ſalvation; and in that reſpect his chaſtiſements which hee ſuffered from Sathans malice to provoke him to ſome ſinful diſtemper, are
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64895:118"/>
ſaid to bee for our peace and healing (by obtaining a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation for us) and ſo he doth heal us, and bring us to God; and ſo ſay the Hebrew Doctors, The death of the Juſt maketh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</p>
                     <p>It is no evill in it ſelf to bee puniſhed from a voluntary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of a combate, but to bee puniſhed in a legal way, through a legal imputation of ſin and guilt, that is a true evill indeed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Take notice in ſome particulars how eminently active <note place="margin">Chriſt was vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary in complying with all his ſufferings, or elſe they had not been me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious. See alſo Ch. 6.</note> Chriſt was in his ſufferings as a voluntary Combater.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 He was lead by the Spirit, that lighted on him at his Baptiſm, into the Wilderneſſe, as ſoon as ever hee was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally inſtalled into the Mediators office, on purpoſe to try Maſteries with the Devils temptations (which no man elſe in the world might preſume to do, but this Captain of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) and in this reſpect all his ſufferings may more fitly bee called active ſufferings, or active paſſive obedience, rather than paſſive obedience, for he put forth a ready and voluntary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with them, and that by way of anticipation, according to Covenant, as a voluntary undertaker of the combate for our Redemption; and this kind of obedience in his ſufferings, made his chaſtiſements to be meritorious for our peace, and for our healing, as the Dialogue ſhews in p. 49.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Take another inſtance of Chriſts voluntary obedience, in entring into the Liſts with Sathan as the Captain of our ſalvation, in all that long buſineſſe that is called his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 He manifeſted himſelf to bee continually mindful of that hour that God had appointed to bee for his apprehenſion and death, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 50. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 23, 27. &amp;c. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 1. and in verſe 2, 3.

Joh. 13. 11.) therefore hee was active, and provoked <hi>Judas</hi> at Supper to go out, ſaying unto him, <hi>What thou doeſt, do quickly,</hi> Joh. 13. 27. and then ſaith hoe, <hi>The Son of man goes as it is determined</hi> (namely by a mutual Covenant) <hi>Luke</hi>

22. 22. and then ſaid he, <hi>The Prince of this world cometh</hi> (to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with mee, with more armed violence than formerly) but ſaith hee, <hi>Hee hath nothing in me,</hi> Joh. 14 30. hee hath no juſt ground to accuſe mee for breaking the Laws of the combate, and therefore hee cannot hinder me from winning the prize; and when Chriſt aroſe to go to the Garden, where hee knew hee muſt bee apprehended, he ſaid thus to his Diſciples, <hi>As my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave me a Commandement</hi> (or Appointment) <hi>ſo I do; Ariſe, let us go hence,</hi> Joh. 14. 31. It is my Fathers appointment, and it is my Covenant that I ſhould now ariſe to meet theſe armed Arch-Inſtruments of Sathan. And when <hi>Judas</hi> and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers came to apprehend him, hee ſaid to the chief Prieſts, <hi>This is your hour, and the power of darkneſſe</hi> (you have full liberty to do your worſt againſt me) <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 53. And when <hi>Peter</hi> went about to protect him from their power by his ſword, hee would not bee protected from Sathans power, and therefore hee bid him to put up his ſword; for ſaid hee, <hi>If I had a mind to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected from their power, I could pray to my Father, and he would give me more than twelve Legions of Angels; But how then</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>ſhall the Scriptures he fulfilled,</hi> that ſay, <hi>This it muſt be?</hi> Matth. 26. 53, 54. for the Scriptures ſay, <hi>That I muſt be pierced as a Malefactor in the Foot-ſoals,</hi> Gen. 3. 15. and ſo like wiſe in the hands, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 16.

And then becauſe he knew all things, and what ſhould befal him, he went forth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 4. namely, to meet the Devils Inſtruments that came to apprehend him, <hi>Joh</hi> 18. 6. And as ſoon as hee had but ſaid unto them, <hi>I am Hee</hi> (that muſt break the Devils Head-plot by my conſtant patience and obedience)
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64895:119"/>
they all fell to the ground at his word ſpeaking, and there hee kept them, for his Diſciples ſake, untill they might have liberty to depart; and if hee would hee might have departed as well as they, but inſtead of departing, he put forth another act of his divine power to raiſe them up again, that ſo hee might bee active in delivering himſelf unto their power, to bee appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and to bee bound as a Malefactor, and ſo to be carried before the Elders of the people; And thus hee was active to drink of the bitter Cup that his Father had given him, for hee had ſaid but a little before unto <hi>Peter, Put up thy ſword</hi> (and protect me not againſt theſe furies of Sathan) <hi>ſhall I not drink of the Cup that my Father hath given me?</hi> namely, by his appointment, and by mine own agreement from eternity.</p>
                     <p>By theſe, and ſuch like paſſages, it is evident, that Chriſt was eminently voluntary and active in all his ſufferings and comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings with Sathan, as a good Shepherd that doth readily ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his life againſt the Lion and the Bear for the ſafety of his ſheep, he ſuffered nothing by conſtraint from his Fathers wrath, through his judicial imputation of our ſins, being preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed under the ſenſe of the wrath of God, as Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> terms are, but God was pleaſed to let Sathan looſe, to oppreſſe him, to wound, and to bruiſe him, and to put him to as much grief as hee could, to diſturb his patience, and to pervert him in the courſe of his obedience, when his ſoul ſhould make it ſelf an offering, that ſo hee might prevent his ſacrifice, by which means only, it was decreed that the Devils Head-plot muſt be broken.</p>

                     <p>Hence it follows, that ſeeing the Devil could not, neither by his fraudulent temptations in the Wilderneſs, nor yet by his temptations of force in the Garden, and on the Croſſe, provoke him to any impatience, or to any diſobedience, by his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious tortures, when his ſoul ſhould make an offering, but that ſtill hee continued conſtant in his obedience, and at laſt did make his ſoul a ſacrifice by his own Prieſtly power, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of the voluntary Covenant; his death and ſufferings muſt needs bee meritorious for the obtaining of Gods Reconciliation, and mans Redemption from Sathans Head plot.</p>

                  <p>THe Expoſition given by the Dialogue of this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated term <hi>[The Lord hath laid upon]</hi> is found and good Divinity, and not confuted by Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> Anſwer, hee cannot hence mantain the point of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting our ſins to Chriſt, which is the main thing controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and which I have already replied unto in Ch. 7.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe I received ſome Animadverſions from a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Divine that gave another Tranſlation than formerly I followed, and from thence he alſo gave another differing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition from mine, by means whereof I was put to a ſtand for a time, though after ſerious ſeeking unto God by prayer, conference, reading, and meditation upon the Context, I came at laſt to a more cleer apprehenſion of the meaning of the words, to my ſatisfaction; for upon the ſaid ſearch, I could not find that the Prophet in this Text did ſpeak <hi>of Gods judicial imputing</hi> our ſins to Chriſt, or that it ſpake any thing directly of Gods judicial inflicting our deſerved penalties (namely Hell torments) upon Chriſt, becauſe no verſe either before or after this verſe, did conclude any ſuch thing; and therefore upon ſerious conſideration, I durſt not take this verſe in that ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe I am no Linguiſt, yet I love ſometimes to ſearch into <hi>Kirkeroes</hi> Hebrew-Greek Lexicon, to ſee in how many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſenſes the Seventy do render the Hebrew words; and ſometimes in more difficult caſes, I love to confer with ſuch as are learned in the Tongues. And by this means I find that the Hebrew word <hi>Pagah</hi> in this verſe doth ſignifie to <hi>Meet,</hi> and becauſe it is in the conjugation <hi>Hiphil,</hi> it doth ſignifie
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:64895:120"/>
to <hi>Cauſe to meet;</hi> ſo then the words muſt run thus, <hi>The Lord cauſed him to meet,</hi> namely, the Father cauſed the Mediator to meet, to conſult the way of fallen mans Redemption from Sathans Head-plot; and in that meeting all the Trinity were equal Counſellors and Covenanters; but the Father is ſaid to make or cauſe the meeting, becauſe he is firſt in order, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is but one will in the Trinity, therefore in <hi>Jer.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 30. 21.</note> 30 21. the Father ſaith thus in commendation of Chriſt, <hi>Who is this that (hath) ingaged his heart to approach unto me, ſaith the Lord?</hi> Now hence it may fitly bee demanded how Chriſt did ingage his heart? the anſwer is, that he did it by way of Contract or Covenant; and therefore the Hebrew word <hi>Gnarab,</hi> which wee tranſlate ingaged, doth properly ſignifie no more but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction or joyning together, but in this place it relates to the conjunction of the Father and the Son in a Covenant for mans Redemption, and accordingly it is ſometimes put for a conjunction of perſons in a league or confederation, as I have ſhewed at large in my Treatiſe of <hi>Holy Time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But thus the whole verſe in <hi>Jeremy</hi> may bee read and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſed, <hi>His excellent one ſhall bee of himſelf, and his Ruler ſhall go forth from the midſt of him, and I will cauſe him to draw neer,</hi> namely, as a Prieſt, with an acceptable ſacrifice; for this Hebrew word is uſed in <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 2. for offering an oblation, or bringing neer a gift; ſo then to bring neer, or approach neer unto God, is to offer unto him, and to offer a ſacrifice for ſin, is to make At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement: See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 26. and therefore one of theſe is uſed for another, as in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 1. they brought neer burnt offerings; for which in <hi>2 Sam.</hi> 6. 17. is written, <hi>David</hi> offered burnt offerings; ſo in <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. 14, 16, 17. <hi>The Nazarite ſhall bring neer his oblation, and the Prieſt ſhall bring them neer,</hi> that is, both the Nazarite and his ſacrifice: And ſaith God of Chriſt, <hi>I will cauſe him to draw neer, and approach unto me; for who is this that hath ingaged his heart, or conjoyned himſelf with me in a Covenant to do my will for mans Redemption?</hi> And in anſwer to this Covenant, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>In burnt offerings and ſacrifices for ſin, thou haſt had no pleaſure, then ſaid I, Lo I come to do thy will, O God, thy Law is in my heart,</hi> Pſal. 40. 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. and ſaith <hi>Ainſworth</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. 14. <note place="margin">Pſal. 40. 8.</note> Chriſt draweth neer unto God for his people, and there hee
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:64895:121"/>
citeth this Text of <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 21. and ſo alſo through Chriſts ſacrifice wee have boldneſſe to draw nigh to God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22.</p>
                  <p>2 As theſe words <hi>(He cauſed him to meet)</hi> may bee applied to the meeting of the Trinity, for the conſtituting of the eternal Covenant, ſo they may bee applied alſo in ſpeech of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the ſaid eternal Covenant, when Chriſt met his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his ſacrifice of Attonement, and then the words muſt go thus, <hi>The Father made or conſtituted Him,</hi> namely, <hi>his Son, to meet him as a Prieſtly Mediator, with his appointed ſacrifice of his vital ſoul, to attone his wrath for the iniquities of us all, that by nature had gone aſtray like loſt ſheep,</hi> as it is expreſſed in the beginning of the verſe.</p>
                  <p>And thus this meeting may bee underſtood both of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Council and Covenant of the Trinity, and alſo of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it.</p>
                  <p>3 The Learned ſay, that the Hebrew word <hi>Pagah</hi> in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugation <hi>Hiphil,</hi> comes no more but ſix times in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, namely, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 12. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 16. <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 36. 25. <hi>Job</hi> 36. 32.</p>
                  <p>Now the laſt five places are rendred both by <hi>Tremelius,</hi> and by our Engliſh Tranſlations, for ſuch a meeting, as is by way of mediation, intreaty, or interceſſion.</p>
                  <p>Though properly the Hebrew word ſignifies no more but to make to meet, or to appoint ſome perſons to meet for ſeveral ends; but yet in the ſaid five places it is applied to a meeting by way of interceſſion: As for example, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 12. Hee made him to meet for Tranſgreſſors, namely, by way of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for Tranſgreſſors, as our Tranſlations do phraſe it.</p>
                  <p>2 In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 16. Hee wondred that none was made to meet, namely, as an Interceſſor; the <hi>Geneva</hi> ſaith, Hee wondred that none would offer himſelf; the Seventy ſay, Hee wondred that there was none to deliver. But the firſt ſenſe is moſt full with the Hebrew.</p>
                  <p>3 In <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 11. I will make, or cauſe the enemy to meet thee in the time of thy affliction, or I will cauſe him to intreat thee well; The Seventy ſay, to aſſiſt thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:64895:121"/>
4 In <hi>Jeremy</hi> 36. 25. The three men (there named) had made to meet, namely, they had made an agreement (as <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends did, <hi>Job</hi> 2. 11.) to meet the King, as Interceſſors, that hee would not burn the rowl; The <hi>Geneva</hi> ſay, They beſought him; But the Seventy ſay, They oppoſed or reſiſted him, namely, by their interceſſion and intreaties.</p>
                  <p>5 In <hi>Job</hi> 36. 32. <hi>With clouds he covereth the light, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it by that which commeth betwixt.</hi> Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> reads it thus, Hee chargeth it, as men do pray, namely, hee chargeth the clouds, as men do intercede by prayer, and <hi>Tremelius</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to that ſenſe; and that ſenſe may cauſe us to remember Gods promiſe in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 35, 36. <hi>When they pray, I will give rain upon the Lands;</hi> and it may alſo cauſe us to remember <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 14. and <hi>Zach.</hi> 10. 1. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing theſe five places in the conjugation <hi>Hiphil</hi> do ſignifie to cauſe, or make a meeting, and all of them by way of mediation or interceſſion, Doubtleſſe the firſt place in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 6. muſt in reaſon have the like ſignification.</p>

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 3. If the Hebrew word for ſin, bee taken in a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical <note place="margin">Sin is often taken in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical ſenſe for a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures Gods At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for ſin.</note> ſignification, as well as in a proper, then there is no contrary ſenſe, though there is a differing ſenſe; hee that ſhall point to a Prieſt making a ſacrifice for ſin, may ſay there is a ſin; and he that ſhall point to <hi>Cain</hi> killing <hi>Abel,</hi> may alſo ſay there is a ſin; the word Sin therefore muſt bee taken in each place where it is uſed, as the Context ſhall direct, ſometimes in a proper ſenſe, and ſometimes in a metaphorical; And for the want of this obſervation, a man may make a contrary ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Piaculum,</hi> or elſe not.</p>
                     <p>The word Sin in <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 10. is there put for the Sin-offering, and that ſin is by the Seventy called the purgation of ſin, and in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 24. they render it the expiation of ſin, and in <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 36. the cleanſing of ſin, and in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43. 22. the Propitiation or Reconciliation, and in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 27. the appeaſing for ſins, and in <hi>Num.</hi> 19. 12, 13, 19. the Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And the reaſon why ſin is named by theſe ſeveral names, is, becauſe the Sin-offering was ordained to appeaſe Gods anger, to expiate, to purge, and to cleanſe the ſinner from his ſin; yea the word ſin is rendred by the Seventy, the change, or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change in <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 1. and that moſt fitly, becauſe the ſin (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Sin-offering) doth cauſe a true change in the ſinner from unclean to clean, and from enmity to Reconciliation. Theſe and ſuch like phraſes given to ſin by the figure <hi>Metonymia,</hi> ſhews the word to have a differing ſenſe, but not a contrary ſenſe, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> affirms, to amuſe his Reader; the like happily may be ſaid to his other Inſtances: But for further light, See what I have replied to the ſignification of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

4 I will now return to ſpeak further of the Hebrew word <hi>Pagah;</hi> take it without the conjugation <hi>Hiphil,</hi> and then it ſignifies only to meet; but the particular occaſions of every meeting, muſt bee ſought out by the circumſtances of each place where the word is uſed. As for example.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 It ſignifies the meeting of the bounds of the Tribes in this or that place.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 It may ſignifie the meeting of time, as when the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon doth meet with the Afternoon, or the meeting of words, or the meeting of perſons for this or that end, either in mercy, or in wrath.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 <hi>Pagah</hi> to meet, is applied to Gods meeting with man, or to mans meeting with God in his worſhip. Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron, <hi>ſaid unto</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us, and commanded us to go into the wilderneſſe to offer ſacrifices to him; therefore wee pray thee, let us go three dayes journey to ſacrifice to the Lord our God, leſt hee meet us with Peſtilence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 18. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 3. So alſo in <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. 3, 4, 5, 15. 16. <hi>Balaam</hi> did mee the Lord with ſacrifice, and the Lord was pleaſed to meet him with words of advice what he ſhould ſay to <hi>Balack:</hi> In theſe places <hi>Pagah</hi> is put for Gods meeting with man, and mans meeting with God. And in <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. 8. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to the people of the land, <hi>If it bee your mind that I ſhould bury my dead, meet with</hi> Ephron <hi>for mee;</hi> namely, meet him by way of intreaty; the Seventy ſay, Speak for mee: And ſo <hi>Ruth</hi> ſaid to <hi>Naomi, Meet mee not to leave thee,</hi> that is to ſay, Meet me not by thy earneſt intreaties to leave thee, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1. 16.</p>
                     <p>So <hi>Jacob</hi> met <hi>Eſau,</hi> namely, with an acceptable preſent, to cover his face, that is, to appeaſe his anger, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 20. as we ſee it did in <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. 8, 10. Theſe Inſtances ſhew that <hi>Pagah</hi> is uſed for a meeting in divers reſpects.</p>
                     <p>And after this manner God ordained Chriſt to bee our High Prieſt to meet the Lord with that moſt acceptable gift of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <note place="margin">Chriſt attoned his Fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wrath with the Sacrifice of his body &amp; blood.</note> in a Sacrifice; for it is of neceſſity that every Prieſt that meets with God, to mediate his reconciliation to ſinners, muſt have ſuch an excellent thing to offer unto God, as hee will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and therefore it muſt bee that which is conſtituted by a mutual Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 3. and the thing appointed was the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eſt thing that Chriſt had to meet God withal, and that was
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:64895:123"/>
his vital ſoul, with his body and blood, offered in perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Gods will, notwithſtanding Sathan endeavoured to diſturb his obedience; with this preſent Chriſt did meet his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Father, that was moſt juſtly provoked by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and by our ſins; and ſo according to Covenant, God accepted this Prieſt and Sacrifice for the attoning, and the appeaſing of his wrath, as the word Attonement doth ſignifie. Of which word, ſee more in Chap. 14. pag. 142, 143.</p>
                     <p>In this ſenſe, I ſay, the Father made, or cauſed the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to meet him for the iniquities of us all.</p>
                     <p>1 He met his Father in his eternal Council and Contract: And 2 In the execution of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pagnin</hi> renders this verſe two wayes, indifferently.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1 <hi>Occurrere fecit ei poenam.</hi>

                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p>And both theſe readings may well agree to the ſame ſenſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 He made the iniquities of us all to meet upon him, namely, hee made him to undertake our ſins, as our Prieſt and Sacrifice, to make Attonement for them; and in this ſenſe the Dialogue hath expounded this verſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Lord made him to meet for the iniquities of us all, or cauſed him to meet him as our Prieſtly Mediator with the Sacrifice of his body, for the iniquities of us all. And thus both readings do agree to the ſame ſenſe; but becauſe the laſt is more exact according to the Hebrew, therefore now I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that.</p>
                     <p>The Chaldy Paraphraſe of this verſe ſpeaks thus, And the <note place="margin">So Mr. <hi>Clendon</hi> in Juſtification juſtified, p. 11.</note> Eternal is well pleaſed to remit the ſins of us all for his ſake.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Tindal</hi> tranſlates it thus:</p>
                     <p>But through him the Lord pardoneth all our ſins.</p>
                     <p>From theſe Tranſlations and Expoſitions it follows,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That the Doctrine of Gods imputing our ſins to Chriſt, in Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> ſenſe, was not held forth by theſe Tranſlators, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be proved from this verſe, nor from any other, when the right interpretation is given, and Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth thus much in general, That the guilt of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Dialogue alſo affirmeth that God the Father bears, or bears away our ſins as a reconciled ſupreme, by acquitting us of our ſins upon ſatisfaction received by the ſaid propitiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Chriſt; But Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> makes a wrong ſenſe of the Dialogue in this point, as if the Dialogue held that the Creditor paid the debt, becauſe he is ſaid to diſcharge the Debtor.

This ſpeech they do not generally ſo ſpeak, is an acknowledgement that ſome do ſo ſpeak: And indeed many late Writers do ſay, That impoſition of hands, with confeſſion of ſin, did typifie Gods imputing our ſins to Chriſt. See <hi>Taylor</hi> on Types; and <hi>Weams</hi> on the Ceremonial Laws, ſaith thus on the Sin-offering, They were commanded to lay their hands upon the head of the Sin-offering, <hi>Lev</hi> 4. to ſignifie, that they laid over their ſins upon the Beaſt, which was a type of Chriſt, who was made <hi>(Aſham)</hi> an offering for ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10. and was made ſin for us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. that is, The guilt of our ſins was imputed to him; he was not made a ſacrifice only for our ſins, but hee was made ſin for us. In theſe words of Mr. <hi>Weams,</hi> and more alſo which I omit, hee hath not a word of our faith of dependance, which was truly typified by Impoſition of hands, but he doth only ſay that it typified Gods imputing our ſins.

If ſin was imputed at all to the Scape-goat, it is ſure enough that it muſt bee done before its eſcape, for after it was eſcaped, it was too late to lay on hands upon the head of it.

                     <p>This Argument Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> hath not anſwered, but evaded with a by-anſwer; but ſaith Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> If the Debtor bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and the Bill cancelled, doubtleſſe the Surety is free: I have oft replied, That ſeeing Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth hold that Chriſt (as our legal Surety) hath made full ſatisfaction in kind, both by fulfilling the Law of Works, and ſuffering the eternal curſe, thence it follows, according to his own concluſion, That the Surety having paid the full debt, and cancelled the Bill, the finner is free from all ſin, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> and ſo not liable to ask any pardon for ſin at Gods hand, nor liable to any temporal plague, no more than <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency: But ſay I, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his ſatisfaction was but the <hi>tantidem,</hi> therefore it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, even as I have ſhewed in Chap. 4.</p>
                     <p>2 This concluſion of Mr. <hi>Nortons,</hi> If the Debtor bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and the Bill cancelled, then doubtleſſe the Surety is free, ſeems to bee drawn from <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14. (as hee hath cited it above) <hi>Blotting out the hand-writing of Ordinances that was againſt us, which was contrary to us, he took it out of the way, nayling it to the Croſſe.</hi> I ſay, his concluſion from this Scripture, is a groſſe abuſe of this Scripture, for though Chriſt hath blotted out
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:64895:130"/>
the hand-writing of the Ceremoaial Laws that was againſt us, yet for all that the moral Law doth ſtill continue againſt us, and doth continually charge us with the breach thereof, and therefore the debt of puniſhment due to us for ſin is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged in full, in reſpect of temporal plagues, though it bee diſcharged in full in reſpect of eternal condemnation to all that beleeve in the Promiſea Seed; I ſay, that till the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, all the godly do ſtill ſuffer for ſin both in their life, in their death, and in their putrifaction in their graves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do ſtill ſtand in need of the daily interceſſion of Chriſt for the pardon of their ſins by the ſatisfaction of Chriſt continually preſented unto God; and in this reſpect Chriſt doth ſtil bear away our ſins in heaven by his Prieſtly interceſſion, as much as ever hee did when he was here upon earth, as I noted afore in <hi>Reply</hi> 4. And this doth plainly ſhew, that the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt was not <hi>Ejuſdem,</hi> but <hi>Tantidem.</hi> If Chriſt had been our legal Surety to pay the uttermoſt farthing in kind at his death, then our Redemption had been perfect at once; but becauſe his ſatisfaction was but the <hi>tantidem,</hi> therefore it was agreed, that wee ſhould have our Redemption but by degrees; and therefore wee muſt ſtill wait for the full redemption of our bodies till the time appointed, as I have ſhewed in Chap. 4.</p>
                     <p>3 Hence it follows, that this legal Court-way, in making Chriſt a legal Surety, &amp; ſo liable to ſuffer the eternal curſe from Gods legal imputation, &amp;c. is none of Gods way in point of ſatisfaction (as I have often noted, to have it the better marked, and ſearched into) but it was the Devils way to make Chriſt a legal ſinner, and to that purpoſe hee ſtirred up falſe witneſſe to make a legal proof of his ſinful imputations, and then hee ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up <hi>Pilate</hi> to proceed to a legal condemnation of him to the odious death of the Croſſe; and hence ſome infer (to admiration) that when <hi>Pilate</hi> ſate on his Tribunal, God ſate on his Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to ſentence Chriſt with the eternal curſe; as if <hi>Pilates</hi> Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proceedings, were a type of God the Fathers Court-proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but I have oft noted, that Gods way was to commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Sathan to bee Chriſts Combater, and to afflict him to his utmoſt skill, and that Chriſt was to win the victory by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice, and obedience.</p>

                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1. MR. <hi>Nortons</hi> firſt comparative Argument can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hold firm for theſe Reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Becauſe it is not framed to the words of the Text.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Becauſe it is not framed to the ſenſe of the Text.</p>
                  <p>1 It is not framed to the words of the Text, becauſe hee makes Chriſt to bee made ſin for us by Gods imputation, in the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64895:131"/>
ſame manner as wee are made righteous by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, for hee means it of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and ſo hee opens his meaning in page 230. and in other places, that we are made righteous by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed; but any one that hath eyes in his head, may ſee, that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe expreſſed in the Text, is called the righteouſneſſe of God, and not the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, therefore his Argument is not framed to the words of the Text.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, the righteouſneſſe expreſſed is not the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God eſſentially, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> makes it to bee in page 230. but the righteouſneſſe of God the Father perſonally (and yet this nothing hinders but that the juſtification of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving ſinners is the work of the Trinity, becauſe they have an order of working in the ſeveral cauſes) and this is moſt cleer and evident, becauſe the Apoſtle doth plainly diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Chriſt, from verſe 19, to the end of verſe 21. For, ſaith the Apoſtle in verſe 19. <hi>God was in Chriſt,</hi> thereby plainly noting two diſtinct perſons. I grant that others have <note place="margin">The miſtaking of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God, for the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, in 2 Cor. 5. 21. is the cauſe of an erronious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</note> miſtaken the word God, for the word Chriſt, before him, but had he been well adviſed, hee might have followed ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Divines that have more narrowly ſearched, not only into the words, but alſo into the ſenſe of this Text, and that have given their grounds for the differencing of the righteouſneſſe of God, from the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and then he might have been better adviſed, then to confound the righteouſneſſe of God with the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, as hee doth without diſtinction, in page 230. and elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>But thirdly, in caſe the righteouſneſſe of God in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. and in other places, had been meant of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth make it, then the Text ſhould have run thus, <hi>God made him to be ſin for us which knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt in him;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>That we might be made the righteouſneſſe of Christ in Chriſt;</hi> and then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this interpretation, the word <hi>God</hi> muſt bee blotted out of the Text, and the word <hi>Chriſt</hi> put into the place of it: But I beleeve that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> will abhor to ſay that the word <hi>God</hi> muſt be blotted out to put the word <hi>Chriſt</hi> into the place of it, and therefore by the ſame reaſon hee ſhould abhor to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the righteouſneſſe of God to bee no other but the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:64895:131"/>
righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, eſpecially, ſeeing there is as much difference between them in the point of a ſinners righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or juſtification, or reconciliation, as there is between the meritorious and formal cauſes of a ſinners juſtification or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</p>
                  <p>I grant, that Chriſt is our righteouſneſſe in the meritorious cauſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. but I ſay alſo, that it is God the Fathers righteouſneſſe, that is the formal cauſe of our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>4 Mr. <hi>Anthony Wotton</hi> doth judiciouſly demonſtrate that the Apoſtle did not intend any compariſon here; and he doth alſo give two reaſons, why the righteouſneſſe of God cannot bee meant of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt in this Text, to which I refer the Reader for further ſatisfaction, <hi>de Reconc.

                  <p>2 I Will now labour to ſhew the true ſenſe of this Text, by which it will appear, that Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> comparative Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not framed to the ſenſe of this Text: each clauſe in the Text lies thus:</p>

                  <p n="5">5 <hi>To bee ſin for us:</hi> that is to ſay, To bee a Sin-ſacrifice for us, as it is rightly and fully opened in the Dialogue; this phraſe, <hi>He was to be made ſin for us</hi> (ſaith the Dialogue) muſt not bee taken in a proper literal ſenſe, but in a metaphorical ſenſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

borrowed from the Levitical Law, where the ſacrifices for ſin are often called <hi>Sin</hi> in the Hebrew Text, though our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Tranſlations have added the word Sacrifice by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; as for example in <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 14, 36. the Hebrew ſaith thus, It is a ſin, but wee tranſlate it thus, It is a Sin-offering, we adde the word Offering to the word Sin, as the Hebrew text alſo ſometimes doth, though very rarely, as in <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 26. and <hi>Lev.</hi> 9. 15. the Prieſt that offereth it for ſin; this is very neer the word Sin-offering, but almoſt every where the Hebrew doth call it a ſin without any addition, as in <hi>Ex. 29. 14, 36.

                  </p>
                  <p>In all theſe places the Sin-offering is called Sin in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew text; and this Hebraiſm the Septuagint do follow, and the Chaldy Paraphraſe, and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. and in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26. and the uſe was to expiate moral ſins done in ignorance; but chiefly it was to expiate their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſins, as the places cited do witneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Scriptures do ſtare in the face of ſuch as make Chriſt to bee ſin for us by a judicial imputation, as Judges do when they impute ſin to Malefactors, as the meritorious cauſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting legal puniſhments upon them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 It is added <hi>[which knew no ſin]</hi> namely, no ſin formally, neither by inherent corruption, nor by Gods legal imputation, and yet notwithſtanding, though he was every way free, God did let Sathan looſe upon him, as upon a Malefactor, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with his humane nature, to inſnare him in ſome ſin or other, and to impute ſin to him, and ſo to peirce him in the Foot-ſoals as a wicked Malefactor on the Tree; and in this ſenſe it is ſaid by <hi>Peter,</hi> that God made him to bear our ſins in his body on the Tree; theſe puniſhments of ſin Chriſt ſuffered not neceſſarily (as we guilty ſinners do) from Gods formal
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:64895:132"/>
imputation of ſin, but voluntarily as a Combater with Sathan, without any formal guilt or deſert on his part.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, He bare our ſins as our Prieſt and Sacrifice, by procuring Reconciliation, and therefore he is ſaid in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10. to make himſelf <hi>Aſham,</hi> a Treſpaſſe, or Sin, as the Septuagint tranſlate it.</p>
                  <p>And thus you ſee, that Chriſt made himſelf to bee ſin, as much as God made him to be ſin, namely, to be a ſacrifice for ſin, and no otherwiſe, as I have ſhewed in the Dialogue in page 42.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 The reaſon or the end why God made him to be ſin, is <note place="margin">It is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of each perſon in Trinity to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants to each other for the orderly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling and juſtifying of the Elect. Rom. 5. 18.</note> added in the next clauſe <hi>[That we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God]</hi> and this doth call to our conſideration the Covenant between the Trinity for mans Redemption, for the Text ſaith, <hi>That God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf,</hi> verſ. 19.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Conſider, that Chriſt covenanted with his Father to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with Sathan, and at laſt to be made a ſacrifice for ſin as the meritorious cauſe, for our reconciliation and juſtification. And hence it follows that as ſoon as hee had performed the ſaid Sin-ſacrifice, it is truly called His righteouſneſſe in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. and this is the true and full interpretation of the word Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in that Text.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 On the other hand the Stipulation or Covenant of the Father, was, that upon the performance of Chriſts ſacrifice, he would bee reconciled to beleeving ſinners, and the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this reconciliation on God the Fathers part, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Righteouſneſſe of God in this Text; and in this ſenſe the Argument of the Apoſtle doth run, from verſe 19. to the end of this 21. verſ.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 <hi>In Him:</hi> that is to ſay in Chriſt; for as ſoon as ſinners are in Chriſt, by the work of the Holy Ghoſt, they are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Gods righteouſneſſe; for according to his Covenant with Chriſt, it is his righteouſneſſe to bee fully reconciled to ſinners, as ſoon as they are in Chriſt by faith, by which means their fins are pardoned, and ſo they are juſtified from ſin, or made formally righteous by this righteouſneſſe of God the Father.</p>
                  <p>And thus have I opened the true ſenſe of this verſe, by which it doth appear, that Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> firſt comparative Argument
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:64895:133"/>
is not framed, neither to the words, nor to the true ſenſe of this verſe.</p>

Doth not the very repetition of this Argument plainly enough ſhew the dangerouſneſſe of it?</p>
                  <p>3 Mr. <hi>Anthony Wotton</hi> ſhews, that it is a palpable miſtake to aſſert the imputation of our ſins to Chriſt in the ſenſe of Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> in <hi>Reconcil.

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 3. A byaſſed ſpirit is apt to pick an exception againſt the cleereſt expreſſions; the Dialogue ſpeaks plainly, that the water of Purification was called Sin, <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. 9. not in reſpect of any ſin that was typically imputed to it, nor was it called Sin, becauſe it was imployed to any ſinful uſe, but becauſe it was ordained in the preſcript uſe of it, to cleanſe the ſinner, <hi>ex opere operato</hi> from all ſuch ceremonial ſins as he was defiled with See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Num.</hi> 19. 9, 12. &amp;c. it was called Sin-water (as the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:64895:134"/>
Sin-offering was called Sin) becauſe it was the water of Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication from ſin, and becauſe it ſanctified the unclean to the purifying of the fleſh, <hi>Num.</hi> 8. 7, 21. and becauſe it figured the blood of Chriſt, which only purgeth the conſcience from dead works, that is to ſay, from moral ſins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13, 14. Now the <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 13, 14.</note> Argument of the Dialogue is plain, namely, that as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of purification was called Sin, becauſe it did truly cleanſe the ſinner from the outward contagion of his ſins, whether moral ſins that were done unadviſedly, or ceremonial ſins, for which chiefly the Sin-water was ordained, that being cleanſed therby, they might then approach to Gods preſence in his Sanctuary, or elſe not, upon pain of cutting off, <hi>Num.</hi> 19. 20.</p>
                     <p>The like Reply I might alſo make for the Levitical phraſe taken from the Redemption-mony that was imployed (or part of it at leaſt) to buy the publick Sin-offerings, and Treſpaſſe-offerings, it was called Sin-mony and Treſpaſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 16. <hi>Neh.</hi> 10. 32, 33. not becauſe any ſin or treſpaſſe was imputed to the mony, as if it had been ſinfully gotten, or ſinfully imployed, but becauſe it was imployed to buy the ſaid Sin-offerings and Treſpaſſe-offerings; and in this ſenſe, God made Chriſt to be ſin, and to be a treſpaſſe, not by imputing the ſins of the Elect to him in a judicial way, but by ordaining and conſtituting him to be the true Sin-offering, and to end all Sin-offerings, and to finiſh Treſpaſſe (offerings) and to make Reconciliation for iniquity by the Sacrifice of himſelf, and ſo by this means to bring in an eternal Righteouſneſſe or Reconciliation, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. inſtead of the Ceremonial.

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 5. By this laſt teſtimony of <hi>Grotius,</hi> Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> thinks that he hath knocked the nayl home on the head, and therefore he ſaith that <hi>Grotius</hi> was a man excelling in this kind of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and truly ſo hee was, though I find him to be very much out of the way in ſome things. But in vain doth Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> labour to make <hi>Grotius</hi> his abettor, for ſurely there is no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter oppoſite to Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> imputation than he is. For <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaith thus; Some evil is ſometimes impoſed upon one, or ſome good is taken away; By occaſion indeed of ſome fault; <note place="margin">In his War &amp; Peace, <hi>l,</hi> 2, <hi>c.</hi> 112 <hi>p.</hi> 398.</note> yet not ſo, that the fault is the immediate cauſe of that action, as to the right of doing: He (ſaith he) who by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of anothers debt, hath ingaged himſelf, ſuffers evil: <note place="margin">Sponde Noxs praeſte eſt.</note> But the immediate cauſe of his obligation is his promiſe, as hee who is become ſurety for a buyer, is not properly bound by the bargain, but by his promiſe; So alſo hee who is bound for a Delinquent, is not held by the delinquency, but by his ingagement: And hence it is, that the evil to bee born by him, receives its meaſure not from the fault of the other, but from the power which himſelf had in promiſing: Conſequent whereunto is this (according to the opinion which
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:64895:135"/>
wee beleeve to be the Truer) That no man can by his becoming ſurety loſe his <note n="*" place="margin">Mans Law doth not allow Sureties for capital crimes. <hi>Vide Panormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.

                     <p>But it ſeems the latter Romans ſaw the inconvenience of their Anceſtors Cuſtomes, and therefore they made other Laws in oppoſition thereto. <hi>Vide Codic. lib. 9. Tit. 47. de poenis lege San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus.)</hi>

                     <p>But (ſaith he) If exile or loſſe of mony were in the promiſe, and by the others fault the forfeiture was made, the Surety ſhall bear the loſſe, which yet in him, to ſpeak exactly, will not be a puniſhment, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>And in Chap. 78. hee doth diſtinguiſh upon the word

                     </head>
                     <p n="1">1 That hee did beleeve it to be the truer opinion; That no man can by his becoming Surety loſe his life, becauſe no man hath right over his own life; and therefore thoſe humane exaples of taking away the life of Sureties for the faults of others, though they paſſe for good juſtice in Mr.<hi>Nortons</hi> opinion, yet not in <hi>Grotius</hi> opinion being rectified, nor in the Scriptures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr.<hi>Norton</hi> hath laboured in vain to make <hi>Grotius</hi> his abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in this.</p>

                        <pb n="218" facs="tcp:64895:136"/>
2 Hence it follows, that ſeeing <hi>Grotius</hi> held this as a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that the obligation to puniſhment doth ariſe from me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and that merit is perſonal, having its original from the will, that hee could not hold (as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth) that Chriſt was made legally guilty of our ſins by Gods impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Hence it follows, That the puniſhments that Chriſt ſuffered were not, in true propriety of ſpeaking, legal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe true legal puniſhments muſt bee inflicted for perſonal faults; and therefore hee could not hold that Chriſt ſuffered any puniſhments from Gods vindicative wrath.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Hence it follows, That the puniſhments which Chriſt ſuffered, are ſo called by a certain ſimilitude, but not properly; the wounds received in the trial of Maſteries from the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Champion, are improperly called puniſhments; no ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are properly puniſhments, but ſuch as are legally inflicted for Delinquency.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Hence it follows, That the puniſhments which Chriſt ſuffered, were not inflicted on him from Gods legal and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative wrath; but hee ſuffered them from his voluntary combate with Sathan, and his Inſtruments, as I have at large ſhewed in Chap. 16. and in divers other places.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Hence it is evident, That Chriſt could not in true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of ſpeech bee our legal Surety, in <hi>Grotius</hi> judgement, joyntly bound with us to fulfill the Law, and ſuffer the Curſe, and ſo to pay our full debt in kind, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> holds.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 I grant, notwithſtanding, that Chriſt may improperly be called our Surety, becauſe hee did of his own accord under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the combate with Sathan, and his Inſtruments, for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; and by his conſtant patience and obedience to the death, he overcame them all, and at laſt in the perfection of his obedience he made his ſoul a ſacrifice, by which he obtained the prize, even the Redemption of all the Elect; and thus hee broke the Devils Head-plot as our voluntary Surety, but this kind of voluntary Surety, is as far diſtant from Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> legal Surety as a free Redeemer, is from a delinquent Surety.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 Hence it follows alſo, that in <hi>Grotius</hi> judgement, there
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:64895:136"/>
is a very wide difference between a Surety for mony-matters, and a Surety in criminal caſes; but theſe kinds of Sureties are confounded by Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> without diſtinction, or elſe hee would never have brought the inſtance of <hi>Pauls</hi> ingaging to <hi>Philemon,</hi> verſe 18. to exemplifie Chriſts obligation to his <note place="margin">Philemon v. 13.</note> puniſhments.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 Hence it follows, That though a man may lay down his life for others, as voluntary Sureties, in divers caſes (as Mr. <hi>Weams</hi> ſhews in his four Degenerations, page 358. yet not as legal bounden Sureties.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And (ſaith he) in Sect. 13. Neither can any man find any other imputation in the writings of the Ancient Divines, than that hee took on him to expiate for our ſins, by his blood and ſacrifice according to I <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10. Therefore wee may conclude, that our bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, might bee a ſacrifice for ſin, or dye as a ſinner, although our ſins were not ſo imputed to him, that God accounted him to be guilty of them.</p>
                     <p>And (ſaith he) in Sect. 14. This alſo may yet further appear, becauſe his ſacrifice was ſuch as might bee without ſuch impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; for it was the price of our Redemption, as I ſhewed in <hi>part. 1. lib. 2. cap. 10. n.</hi> 5, 6. But there may well be, and ordinarily is, Redemption by a price, without any kind of imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And you may alſo ſee what hee ſpeaks further to this point in Sect. 7.</p>
                     <p>In theſe words of Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> the Judicious may pleaſe to take notice, that Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> doth confidently affirm theſe two things:</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That there is no other imputation of ſin to Chriſt in all the Scripture, than ſuch as he hath cited out of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Theophilact.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 That no man can find any other imputation in the wrirings of the Ancient Fathers.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Let me adde this Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> both from my own knowledge, and from the teſtimony of other eminent Chriſtians, that Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> was a man of approved integrity,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:64895:137"/>
one that ſuffered much for Chriſt, through the iniquity of the times, a man of great reading in all kind of Writers, both Ancient and Modern, and a man of deep judgement; And his book of Reconciliation, was printed in his old age, after much debate, and ſtudy, and reviſing; and therefore what hee ſaith in this point of imputation, ought not, and will not bee ſlighted of the Judicious. The wiſe will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Hence it follows, That the Reader that pleaſeth, may yet hee more fully ſatisfied by the labours of <hi>Grotius,</hi> that this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of Mr. <hi>Wottons</hi> is a manifeſt truth, namely, That our ſins were no otherwiſe imputed to Chriſt, but as hee bare our puniſhments in his body on the Tree, according to 1 Pet. 2. 24.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Hence it follows, That <hi>Grotius</hi> had good reaſon to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch teſtimonies from the Ancient Divines againſt <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus,</hi> becauſe (as I perceive by ſeveral Writers) <hi>Socinus</hi> denied Chriſts ſufferings to belong to the meritorious cauſe of Chriſts ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 On the other hand, I do alſo beleeve that <hi>Grotius</hi> did as much oppoſe Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> kind of imputation, as hee did <hi>Socinus</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; for I have ſhewed in my former Reply, that <hi>Gretins</hi> held the obligation to legal puniſhments to ariſe from merit, and that merit is perſonal. Secondly, It is further evident, that <hi>Grotius</hi> did oppoſe Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> kind of imputation, becauſe hee doth oppoſe the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal cauſe of our juſtification; for thus hee ſaith, The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe <note place="margin">

                     <p>But the judicious Reader may ſoon ſee that Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is but an evaſion to the Dialogues Argument.</p>
                     <p>For the Dialogue in the margent ſaith thus; Chriſt did impute all our ſins and treſpaſſes to himſelf as much as ever the Father did; for <hi>Iſaiah</hi> doth tell us, That he ſet, or put himſelf to be <hi>Aſhem,</hi>
                        <pb n="223" facs="tcp:64895:138"/>
a Treſpaſſe, or a guilt for us, or to be ſin for us, as the Septuagint render it, and hence the Dialogue doth make this comparative Argument; If God made Chriſt to bee ſin for us by imputing all our ſins and treſpaſſes to him as the obligation to his ſuffering of our curſe from Gods vindicative wrath; then from the ſame kind of phraſe it doth neceſſarily follow, that Chriſt made himſelf to be <hi>Aſham,</hi> a Treſpaſſe, a guilt, or ſin, by his legal imputing of our ſins to himſelf; and ſo by the ſame rule of Court-juſtice, hee muſt likewiſe in a judicial way inflict the eſſential torments of Hell upon himſelf from his vindicative wrath.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> makes no anſwer to this Argument, but inſtead thereof hee ſaith, That Chriſt accepts the charge as a Surety, but did not execute that juſtice which is the part of a Judge; but any man may ſee that by the force of the Argument in the Dialogue, that Chriſt muſt impute ſin to himſelf, and inflict the curſe as much as his Father; or in caſe an anſwer can bee found to excuſe Chriſt from this vindicative act of juſtice, then the ſame anſwer will excuſe the Father from the ſaid legal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of our ſins, and from his vindicative act of juſtice alſo; But if this phraſe, <hi>God made him to be ſin,</hi> doth argue that God made Chriſt a guilty ſinner by his imputation; then this phraſe, Chriſt made himſelf to be ſin, will argue that Chriſt made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a guilty ſinner by his own imputation, and then hee muſt execute as a ſupreme Judge his own vindicative wrath upon himſelf, as well as the Father.</p>
                     <p>This abſurd conſequence ſaith the Dialogue, you cannot avoid; And thus ſaith the Dialogue, by this kind of arguing you make Chriſt to be his own ſelf Accuſer, and his own ſelf Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner.</p>
                     <p>But the truth is, ſaith the Dialogue, Chriſt did no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe make himſelf to be a Treſpaſſe, a a guilt, or ſin, but as hee made himſelf to be a Treſpaſſe-offering, and a Sin-offering, by which offering once for all, he ended Treſpaſſe (offerings) and finiſhed Sin (offerings) and thereby made Reconciliation for iniquity (or reconciled God to beleeving ſianers) and ſo brought in (or pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Alſo another book of great eſteem, called, The Sum of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, ſet forth by <hi>Iohn Downame</hi> in page 317. doth diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between ſin and guilt, and yet at laſt hee concludes as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth, That God did impute both theſe to Chriſt; Firſt, Our ſins; And ſecondly, Our guilt: And for the proof of this, he cites 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21.</p>
                     <p>Do not theſe things ſpeak aloud to all that love the truth in ſincerity, to look better to the expoſition of this, and other Scriptures? It is recorded that one <hi>Auguſtinus de Roma,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Nazaret,</hi> was cenſured in the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> (and that juſtly, as I conceive) for affirming that Chriſt was <hi>pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum maximus,</hi> the greateſt of ſinners.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 Let <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ſhew his judgement how Chriſt was in the ſimilitude of ſinful fleſh, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. It means nothing elſe, ſaith he, but that hee was ſubject unto heat, cold, hunger, thirſt, contumelies, and death, for theſe ſaith he, are the effects of ſin; and therefore, ſaith hee, the fleſh of Chriſt, might well bee called the fleſh of ſin (and the next ſentence runs thus) <hi>Chriſt condemned ſin in the fleſh of ſin;</hi> that is (ſaith he) by that oblation which was for ſin. <note n="*" place="margin">Sin in Rom. 8. 3. is expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a ſacrifice for ſin, by <hi>Origen, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthoe, Bucer, Calvin, Percrius</hi> and <hi>Vatablus.</hi>

                     <p>In theſe words hee ſaith plainly, that Chriſt was no way guilty of our ſins, as the obligation to his death and ſufferings, but that hee admitted death from the voluntary cauſe only. He doth point blank oppoſe Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> Tenent.</p>

                        <hi>Ibidem,</hi> Had not Chriſt dyed voluntarily, his death (ſaith he) had not been meritorious; how much more unworthily hee dyed, that had not deſerved death, ſo much more juſtly (man) liveth for whom he dyed; what juſtice, thou wile ask, is this, That an Innocent ſhould dye for a Malefactor? It is no juſtice,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:64895:141"/>
it is mercy; if it were juſtice, then ſhould hee not dye freely, but indebted thereto; and if indebted, then indeed hee ſhould dye, but the other for whom hee dyed ſhould not live; yet though it bee not juſtice, it is not againſt juſtice, otherwiſe he could not bee both juſt and merciful.</p>
                     <p>If the Reader pleaſe but to review the ſeveral ſpeeches of Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> about the imputation of our ſins to Chriſt, as I have ſet them down in the ſixth Chapter, and compare them with theſe words of <hi>Bernard,</hi> he may ſee as direct an oppoſition as is poſſible.</p>

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:64895:141"/>
The Righteouſneſſe of God the Father. And thirdly, The Holy Ghoſt covenanted to unite the Elect unto Chriſt, that ſo they might bee the fit ſubjects of the ſaid Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>2 I grant, that the righteouſneſſe of God may bee diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into many other ſenſes, as Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> hath ſhewed, <hi>de Reconcil. pec. part. 2. l. 1. c. 20. n.</hi> 3. which ſeveral ſenſes muſt bee conſidered according to the context in each place where it is uſed; but in this place, Gods reconciling the world to himſelf, by not imputing their ſins to them, as it is expreſſed in verſe 19. is called the righteouſneſſe of God in this 21. verſe, becauſe it is the performance of his condition with the Mediator, for the compleating of a ſinners righeouſneſſe that is in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The Reconciliation mentioned (ſaith Mr. <hi>Ball)</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. is explained by the non-imputation, or remiſſion of ſins; at <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ball</hi> on the Covenant, p. 219.</note> leaſt (ſaith he) it is one part or branch of Reconciliation, which is a tranſient act conferred in time, and inferreth a change of ſtate and condition in the party juſtified, or reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and of other reconciliation betwixt God and man, the Scripture ſpeaketh not.</p>
                     <p>In theſe words the Reader may pleaſe to take notice, that Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> doth make the non-imputation of ſin to be all one with juſtification, in the party juſtified or reconciled; and ſo hee makes juſtification to bee the firſt part or branch of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> doth.</p>
                     <p>And ſaith Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> in page 219. The Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9, 10. puts reconciliation by the death of the Son of God, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 9, 10.</note> by Chriſts blood, for the ſame thing merited by Chriſts ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>Theſe obſervations out of Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> may adviſe us, that Gods righteouſneſſe procured by the Sin ſacrifice of Chriſt, in v. 21. is the ſame, or at leaſt a branch of the ſame reconciliation of God, which the Apoſtle hath defined in verſe 19. by his not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſin, and the performance of that reconciliation, or non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imputation of ſin; on Gods part, for the ſake of Chriſts Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacrifice, is called the righteouſneſſe of God the Father, in this 21. verſe; and this expoſition of the righteouſneſſe of God, any indifferent Reader may ſee to be cleerly meant by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, though I ſhould ſay no more. But I will yet further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evidence,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:64895:142"/>
that this expoſition of Gods righteouſneſſe, is no new upſtart expoſition, but that it hath the concurrence, and countenance of other eminent orthodox Divines.</p>
                     <p>1 <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. ſaith thus:</p>
                     <p>Now reſteth to ſee what is the righteouſneſſe of God, and it may thus be defined.</p>
                     <p>It is an Abſolution from ſins, by faith, through Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And (ſaith he) that we may the better underſtand the nature of this Abſolution, we muſt on the other ſide weigh the nature of ſin.</p>
                     <p>Sin is a defect, or falling away, from the Law and Will of God; And to this defect is neceſſarily annexed an obligation to eternal death and damnation.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, when by the mercy of God this obligation and guiltineſſe is taken away, A man is abſolved from his ſins.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ibidem,</hi> Now by theſe things (ſaith he) it is manifeſt what Abſolution is, It is an action of God (the Father) whereby he delivereth and acquitteth us from ſins, that is, from guiltineſſe and obligation to eternal death.</p>
                     <p>But (ſaith he in the ſecond place) that we ſhould not think that ſo great benefit cometh through our deſert, therefore it is added, through Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And (ſaith he in the third place) that wee ſhould not bee ignorant how the ſacrifice and redemption of Chriſt is, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to every one of us, it is added, by faith.</p>
                     <p>This definition (ſaith he) is a great help to the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of juſtification; and this righteouſneſſe, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Is the righteouſneſſe of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ibidem,</hi> By theſe things (ſaith he) let us gather that this righteouſneſſe of God is far diſtant from the righteouſneſſe

that is known by nature; for neither Reaſon nor Philoſophy knoweth any other Righteouſneſs but that which hath its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in the mind; not that they were ignorant of abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or of the pacifying of God, for that thing did their Sacrifices teſtifie. But this pacifying of God, they did not call our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, neither ever underſtood they the true pacifying of God, nor wherein it conſiſted.</p>
                     <p>Thus far <hi>P. Martyr</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. he had ſpoken of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God afore this, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17. and in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21. but not ſo clearly as here; theſe meditations on <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. were his laſt meditations on that phraſe, and therefore his beſt; for by this time he had the advantage of more reading and meditation to clear up his full mind and meaning. And ſee what he ſaith further of Gods Righteouſneſs, which I have cited in the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 26.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Mr. <hi>Norton, de Reconc. pec. par. 2. l. 1. c.</hi> 20. ſaith at Sect. 4. That 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21, doth comprehend the ſame Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which the Apoſtle may well ſay, is the end or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the oblation of Chriſt; The Righteouſneſs of God. And (ſaith he) it comprehends the righteouſneſs which may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the juſtification of a ſinner. And in Sect. 5. (ſaith he) in the ſecond place, I anſwer, That the righteouſneſs of God in the places alleged, may fitly &amp; rightly enough be expounded of remiſſion of ſins; for it is plain enough (ſaith he) that in all theſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> places is handled the formal cauſe of Juſtification, which (ſaith he) I have taught is contained in Rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſſion of ſins, in <hi>par. 1. l. 2. c.</hi> 17. But remiſſion of ſins may well be called the righteouſneſs of God, becauſe it is a righteouſneſs approved by God. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Calv. Inſti. l. 3. c. 11. n.</hi> 9. doth ſo interpret the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God, to be a righteouſneſs that is approved of God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Mr. <hi>Bale</hi> on the Covenant, in p. 72. calls the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God in <hi>Phil</hi> 3. 9. and in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. the remiſſion of ſins. By the Righteouſneſs of God (ſaith he) underſtand remiſſion of ſins, and regeneration; and conſider what he ſaith in the place immediately cited.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Sedulius,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21. calls the Righteouſneſs of God (there) the remiſſion of ſins.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>Tindal</hi> doth thus open the Righteouſneſs of God,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:64895:143"/>
in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. The Jews (ſaith he) were not obedient to the Juſtice or Righteouſneſs that commeth of God, which is the <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 3. See <hi>Tindals</hi> works, p. 381.</note> forgiveneſs of ſin in Chriſts blood, to all that repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,</p>
                     <p>And (ſaith he) in p. 30. By reaſon of which falſe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, they were diſobedent to the Righteouſneſſe of God; which (ſaith he) is the forgiveneſs of ſin in Chriſts blood.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Tindal</hi> in his Prologue to the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhews firſt, How we are juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of God the Father. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, How we are juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. Thirdly, How we are juſtified by Faith. And in all theſe he ſpeaks juſt according to the ſenſe expreſſed in the Dialogue.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 (Saith he) When I ſay God juſtifieth us, underſtand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that for Chriſt his ſake, merit, and deſervings onely, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth us unto his Mercy, Favor, and Grace, and forgiveth us our ſins.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 (Saith he) When I ſay Chriſt juſtifieth, underſtand thereby that Chriſt onely hath redeemed us, and brought and delivered us out of the wrath of God, and damnation, and with his works onely hath purchaſed us the favor of God, and the forgiveneſs of ſins.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 When I ſay that Faith juſtifieth, underſtand thereby that faith and truſt in the Truth of God, and in the Mercy promiſed us for Chriſts ſake, and for his deſervings onely, doth quiet the conſcience, and certifie her that our ſins are forgiven, and we in full favor of God.</p>
                     <p>And in p. 187. he abreviates the ſpeeches thus, <note place="margin">In his works, p. 187.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The faith (ſaith he) of true beleevers, is, Firſt, That God juſtifieth or forgiveth. Secondly, That Chriſt deſerveth it. Thirdly, That Faith and truſt in Chriſts blood receiveth it, and certifieth the conſcience thereof.</p>
                     <p>And in p. 225. he doth again repeat it thus, God doth juſtifie actively, that is to ſay, forgiveth us for full righteous.</p>
                     <p>2. Chriſts love deſerveth it, And 3. Faith in the Promiſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth it, and certifieth the conſcience thereof.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee that <hi>Tindal</hi> doth fully expreſs himſelf in the very ſenſe of the Dialogue. And this Doctrine hath been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received of the godly in the days of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64895:143"/>
and in the days of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, by the generality of the learned, and it hath been often printed, not onely in his Books, but alſo in his Bible, in his Prologue to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and it hath been tranſcribed and printed by <hi>Marbeck</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon places; though now this antient received Truth, is by Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> and ſome few others counted both for novelty and hereſie.</p>
                     <p>And thus have I ſhewed from five eminent Orthodox Divines, that the Righteouſneſs of God the Father to ſinners, it nothing elſe but his reconciliation, as it is defined by the Apoſtle, by not imputing ſin, in v. 19. which is alſo called the Righteouſneſs of God, in ver. 21. And therefore it follows neceſſarily, that the true ſenſe of the one and twentieth verſe, according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, is this,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That God the Father (from the voluntary cauſe and Covenant) made, or conſtituted, Chriſt to be a Sin Sacrifice for us; namely, to procure Gods Reconciliation for us.</p>

So then the compariſon that is made between the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> and the ſecond, lies in the meritorious cauſe; for as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> merited the death of ſin to all his poſterity, by his diſobedience to Gods poſitive Law and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; ſo the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> merited the life of Gods Spirit, and of Gods forgiveneſs, by his obedience to Gods poſitive Law, in making his ſoul a ſacrifice.</p>

                        <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. It is now apparent why Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> did ſtumble at the Dialogue, for giving two parts to Reconciliation, according to Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> It was to introduce his conjectures (quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Mr. <hi>Wotton)</hi> namely, that Gods non-imputation of ſin is an antecedent and means, rather than a part of attonement or reconciliation. But becauſe he expreſſeth himſelf to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what uncertain in his notions in this point, therefore he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought to be a fit Judge to cenſure the Dialogue, nor to determine this controverſie. But the Scriptures are moſt plain in this point, if they be not intricated by ſuch uncertain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The Scripture ſpeaks plainly, that when the Bullock for ſin was offered by the Prieſt to make attonement for ſins of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, then the promiſe annexed ſaith, <hi>It ſhall be forgiven him, Levit</hi> 4. 20. Any man from hence may ſee plainly, that Gods forgiveneſs is not an antecedent, but a true part of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement (if it be not the whole) The like is ſaid of the Rulers ſin, in v. 26. and the like is ſaid of the ſins of any of the people, in ver. 31, 35. namely, that when Gods attonement is procured by their ſaid Sin-Sacrifice, then, thereupon their ſin is ſaid to be forgiven them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Burnt-offerings, And Thirdly, The Treſpaſs-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings were ordained to procure Gods gracious forgiveneſs, as a part of his attonement, as in <hi>Levit.</hi> 5. 10, 13, 16, 18. and in <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 7. and in <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 22. and in <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 25, 26, 28. In all theſe places Gods promiſe of his forgiveneſs by his attonement, did openly proclaim in the ears of all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and in the ears of all others that have ears to hear, that when Gods attonement is obtained by ſacrifice, then, and not till then ſin is forgiven, and then and not till then that perſon is actually juſtified; either he is ceremonially juſtified, as a perſon fit to ſtand before Gods holy preſence in his Sanctuary, or elſe in caſe they have Faith to look from the typicall attonement to the myſtical, they ſhall thereby have an eternal pardon from their moral ſins, and ſo an eternal juſtification in Gods ſight.

                     <p>Gods Reconciliation procured by an acceptable ſacrifice, is not like the Reconciliation of a Judge, that doth but barely acquit a Malefactor, and ſo leaves him; but it is like the Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation of a merciful Father, that doth not only forgive his child, but together with that forgiveneſs, doth alſo receive him into favour; and in this ſenſe theſe two terms, Gods Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and his gracious forgiveneſs for Chriſts ſacrifice ſake, is the ſame thing: And thus Gods forgiveneſs is the whole of his Reconciliation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 This ſenſe of Gods forgiveneſs, as it is the whole of Reconciliation, is evident by Gods promiſe in the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; for in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 34. the promiſe runs thus, <hi>I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their ſin no more.</hi> This promiſe is thus expounded in <hi>Heb. 8. 12.

                     <p n="6">6 This kind of forgiveneſs for the ſake of Chriſts ſacrifice, doth con-note a ſtate of favour that the ſubject is put into by means thereof, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 1. as reconciliation and juſtification doth in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 21. and therefore Gods forgiveneſs, may well be called his merciful forgiveneſs, or his reconciled for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, as Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> doth open Gods forgiveneſs in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 11. and therefore it is not an antecedent, but a concurrent part of Gods Reconciliation, or of Gods Righteouſneſſe, for <note place="margin">Pſal, 25. 11.</note> they have but one and the ſame ſenſe by the context in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 21. though the terms be divers; for I demand, how elſe are wee made righteous by the Righteouſneſs of God the Father, but by his Righteouſneſs in keeping Covenant with Chriſt, which was to bee reconciled to beleeving ſinners for the ſake of his Sin-ſacrifice in not imputing their ſins to them; And thus you ſee that theſe three terms, Gods merciful forgiveneſs, and his Reconciliation, and his Righteouſneſs in making ſinners righteous by his ſaid for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, do all con-note the ſame ſtate of favour, that the ſubject is put into by means thereof, and ſo forgiveneſs is not antecedent, but concurrent to Reconciliation and Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 It is yet further evident that Chriſt was made ſin, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile God withal, and ſo to procure his forgiveneſs for a ſinners juſtification, by the Levitical terms given to the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering, as the procuring cauſe of Gods reconciliation; for it is often ſaid in the Law, that God ordained the Sin-offering to <note place="margin">Lev. 6. 30.</note> reconcile withal, as in <hi>Lev. 6. 30. 2.

For the blood of Buls and Goats, and the aſhes of an Heifer did ſanctifie to the purifying of the fleſh; And hence the Apoſtle doth argue, How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt be of force to procure Gods reconciliation in not imputing ſin, and ſo to cleanſe the conſcience from moral ſins for our eternal righteouſneſs, and therefore anſwerable to the types, God ordained Chriſt by his poſitive Law and Covenant to bee our Burnt-offering, our Peace-offering, our Treſpaſs-offering, our Meat-offering, and our Sin-offering, as the perfection of all the reſt; For by his one offering once offered, hee ended the uſe of all Treſpaſs (offerings) and finiſhed Sin (offerings) and made reconciliation for iniquity, and ſo brought in, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured an everlaſting Righteouſneſs, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. inſtead of their <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 24.</note> Ceremonial reconciliation, which was their Ceremonial righteouſneſs for Gods holy preſence in his Sanctuary.

                     <p>And ſecondly, Theſe Reaſons do prove, That it is Gods righteouſneſs to grant his reconciliation to all beleeving ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for the ſake of Chriſts ſacrifice for their formal and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>And thirdly, Hence it follows, that Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> conjectures, that reconciliation is but a conſequent of juſtification, is fallen to the ground.</p>
                     <p>8 This Righteouſneſs of God being thus explained; It neceſſarily follows, That ſuch as hold Gods Righteouſneſs in being reconciled to ſinners (for the ſatisfaction ſake of Chriſts Sin-ſacrifice) to bee the formality of a ſinners righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, muſt needs deny the imputation of Chriſts moral righteouſneſs to bee the formal cauſe of a ſinners iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>

And truly, I cannot but wonder that he <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 9.</note> ſhould cite it to prove the righteouſneſs of Chriſt as our Surety to the moral Law, ſeeing there is no righteouſneſs of Chriſt expreſſed in this Text; but the righteouſneſs expreſſed is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the righteouſneſs of God, namely of God the Father, juſt as I have opened the phraſe, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. and therefore this righteouſneſs of God in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. muſt have the ſame ſenſe as I have expounded it to have, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21.

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:64895:149"/>
of the Sin-offering, <hi>Ezek. 45. 18, 19. Levit.</hi> 16. 16. and thus we ſee, that when perſons and things are legally cleanſed from cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial defilements, they are ſaid to be juſtified; and therefore the blood of Bulls and Goats, and the aſhes of an Heiſer ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the unclean under the firſt Covenant, to procure Gods attonement for their ceremonial juſtification, did but typifie our moral juſtification by Gods attonement, and forgiveneſs for the ſake of the blood of Chriſts Sin-offering under the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for nothing but Gods attonement, alone doth cleanſe and juſtifie a ſinner, and ſo the Apoſtle doth argue the caſe, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13, 14. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the blood of Buls and Goats, and the aſhes of an Heifer ſprinkling the unclean, did ſanctifie to the purifying of the fleſh;</hi> for by this means onely they procured Gods attonement and forgiveneſs, for their ceremonial defilements (according to Gods appointment in the firſt Covenant of works) for without Gods attonement procured by the uſe of the ſaid legal Rites, their fleſh could not be ſanctified in a fit manner for his holy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in his Sanctuary; and in this reſpect the Seventy do ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the word Attonement, by the word Sanctified, as you ſee it obſerved by <hi>Ainſworth</hi> in <hi>Exod,</hi> 29. 33, 36.</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly, It is alſo further evident by the cleanſing of the woman from her unclean iſſue, for ſhe was not fully clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed untill ſhe had obtained Gods Attonement by her Sin-Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <hi>Levit.</hi> 15. 30. but as ſoon as that was performed, then ſhe had Gods Attonement, and then ſhe is ſaid, in ver. 31. to be ſanctified or ſeparated, for her appearing before God in his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and then ſhe might come as a juſtified perſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger of Gods anger, before his preſence in his holy San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary.</p>
                     <p>And thirdly, The Hebrew Doctors do uſually ſay (as I find them cited in <hi>Ainſworth)</hi> that ſuch perſons as were ceremonial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleanſed by waſhing, or by the ſprinkling of their ſin-water, were ſanctified; that is to ſay, they were legally juſtified, as fit perſons for Gods preſence in his holy Sanctuary.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The blood of Bulls and Goats did ſanctifie, to the purifying of the fleſh, no otherwiſe, but as they procured Gods attonement; for blood materially conſidered doth not cleanſe but defile the fleſh, but as it was ordained by the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to procure Gods attonement, ſo it doth formally cleanſe and juſtifie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="237" facs="tcp:64895:149"/>
Fifthly, It is further evident, that theſe legal cleanſings did ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie them, by procuring Gods attonement for their ceremonial ſins, becauſe Gods eternal attonement and forgiveneſs, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to their legal juſtifications, is called waſhing, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 8. and it is called ſprinkling and cleanſing, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 25, 29.</p>
                     <p>And Sixthly, Such as are truly converted to Chriſt, in the New Teſtament (and by that means have their ſins forgiven them) are ſaid to be Waſhed, Sanctified, and Juſtified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11.</note> 6. 11. And it is worth the marking, that theſe three figurative expreſſions are Synonimous, and do all note the true nature of our juſtification.</p>
                     <p>And from theſe cleanſings according to the firſt Covenant, the Apoſtle in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. 14. doth inforce his Argument thus, <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt purge</hi> (or ſanctifie) <hi>your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences from dead works?</hi> that is to ſay, from moral ſins, for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſins did as much defile the conſcience, as the touch of a dead perſon did defile the fleſh ceremonially: And ſaith he, though the blood of Buls and Goats, and the aſhes of an Heifer, had power by Gods poſitive Covenant to cleanſe to the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the fleſh, yet they had not power to cleanſe or juſtifie the conſcience from moral ſins, <hi>Heb. 9. 9. and</hi> 10. 4. But that power was given to the blood of Chriſt alone, and therefore he ſaid, <hi>Lo I come to do thy will, O God;</hi> by which will we are ſanctified through the offering of the body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10, 14. In theſe words mark the conditions of the eternal Covenant for mans juſtification, as it is expreſſed by <note place="margin">Heb. 10, 10.</note> the Apoſtle, namely, that it was the will of God to be attoned to ſinners for the ſake of Chriſts ſacrifice, and that attonement onely doth cleanſe the conſcience from all moral ſins, or it juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the conſcience.</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly, much after this manner doth the Apoſtle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon touching our juſtification, in <hi>Rom. 8. 3, 4. What the Law could</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 3, 4.</note> 
                        <hi>not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh</hi> (for the corruption and infirmity of the fleſh was ſuch, that it could not keep it ſelf pure neither from moral ſins, nor from ceremonial ſins, as it is diſputed in <hi>Col,</hi> 2. 14. and in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11, 16, 18, 19.) neither could the ceremonial juſtifications juſtifie the conſcience from moral ſins, <hi>Heb. 9. 9. Heb. 10. 4. But God ſending his Son in the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:64895:150"/>
likeneſs of ſinful fleſh,</hi> (becauſe he ſent him to be our Combater with Satan, and gave Satan power to uſe this ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as a ſinful malefactor, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. in this ſenſe he was in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, becauſe he ſuffered all kind of injuries from Satan, as a ſinner,) <hi>and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh;</hi> in theſe words is ſet down the ultimate end why God ſent Chriſt in the ſimilitude of ſinful fleſh, to ſuffer as a Combater with Satan, and that was to break Satans head-plot, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing obedient to the death, and in that obedience to be for ſin; that is to ſay, to make himſelf a ſacrifice for ſin; By which means he did firſt condemn ſin, that is to ſay, the uſe of all the legal Sin-offerings (becauſe they could not juſtifie the conſcience from moral ſins) becauſe his was the perfection of them all, and therefore it was perfectly able to procure his Fathers attonement and abſolution, to cleanſe the conſcience from all the dead works of moral ſins.</p>
                     <p>Thus far of the Expoſition of ver. 3. and then it follows in ver. 4. <hi>That the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us;</hi> or, <note place="margin">Rom. 8, 4.</note> that the Juſtification of the Law may be fulfilled in us, as <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melius,</hi> and the Syriack, and the vulgar Latin, do tranſlate the Greek word <hi>Dicaioma,</hi> that is here uſed.</p>
                     <p>But here it may be demanded, what kind of Righteouſneſs or Juſtification of the Law doth <hi>Dicaioma</hi> mean, ſhould be fulfilled in us?</p>
                     <p>The Anſwer is, Not the righteouſneſs of the moral Law, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth miſ-interpret this Text in p. 233. but the righteouſneſs that was typified by the poſitive Ordinances of the ceremonial Law, for the Greek word here uſed is (not <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caioſune,</hi> which is the largeſt word for all kind of righteouſneſs, but) <hi>Dicaioma</hi> which is more reſtrained to the poſitive Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and which in proper Engliſh doth ſignifie the juſt Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or the righteous eſtate of the Law, namely, either of the Ceremonial or Judicial Laws, but eſpecially of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Laws, as Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> ſheweth, in <hi>Numb.</hi> 31. 21. in <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 5. in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 1, 14. and in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
                     <p>2 This is the true interpretation of <hi>Dicaioma,</hi> as it is further evident, becauſe the Apoſtle doth uſe this word to deſcribe the nature of their legal juſtifications of divine Service, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 1. 10. which he calls carnal juſtifications, in verſ. 10, as
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64895:150"/>
Mr. <hi>Dickſon</hi> and others have well obſerved.</p>
                     <p>3 This word is alſo uſed by the Septuagint, for the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous making of things, as well as of perſons, that were ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nially unclean (for no dead things, or unreaſonable creatures are guilty of moral ſins) but by Gods poſitive Ordinance, they may bee guilty of Ceremonial ſins, <hi>Numb.</hi> 31. 19, 20. 21, 22, 23, 24.</p>
                     <p>4 Hence it follows, That this kind of poſitive ceremonial righteouſneſs was typical to ſuch as had faith in the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe Statutes, to look from the typical ordinances of cleanſing and righteous making, to the poſitive ſacrifice of Chriſt, as the perfection of all the typical cleanſings, for that only was ordained to procure Gods eternal Reconciliation in not imputing ſin, for the cleanſing of the conſcience from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſins; therefore ſuch as did thus keep the Statutes and Ordinances of Righteouſneſs, as <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 6. ſhould obtain thereby an everlaſting Righteouſneſs in Gods ſight, inſtead of the Ceremonial.</p>
                     <p>And this Doctrine is cleerly taught and expreſſed in <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 24, 25. I ſay from theſe verſes it is plain, that their outward <note place="margin">Deut. 6. 24, 25.</note> and legal obſervations of their poſitive Statutes, did make them righteous, or juſtifie their bodies, as fit perſons for Gods holy preſence in his holy Sanctuary, and for feaſting with him (as their attoned God in Covenant) on the fleſh of their Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>overs, and Peace-offerings, and ſo it typifies true juſtification, and therefore their careful doing of theſe typical Ordinances had an outward bleſſing promiſed, as to perſons that were outwardly juſtified, as well as they which had faith in Chriſt, had the promiſe of Gods Reconciliation for their eternal juſtification.</p>
                     <p>5 This word <hi>Dicaioma</hi> is uſed by the Septuagint to expreſs their outward righteouſneſs, or juſtification by their exact care in obſerving the poſitive judicial Laws of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And for this alſo ſee <hi>Ainſworth</hi> in <hi>Exod. 21. 1. Num.</hi> 15. 15.</p>

                     <p>And this is worthy of all due obſervation, That the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of our moral juſtification in the meritorious and formal cauſes, was exemplified by Gods poſitive Statutes and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and therefore the Holy Ghoſt doth moſt fitly expreſs it by this peculiar term <hi>Dicaioma.</hi> And</p>

the aſhes of an Heifer ſprinkling the unclean, which procured Gods attonement for their legal ſins) do by faith look to the end of theſe things, namely, to the death of Chriſt, as the true procuring cauſe of Gods eternal Attonement, and Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, for the purging of their conſcience from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning power of their moral ſins; ſhall not their un circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion (in this caſe) bee counted or imputed to them for true circumciſion, and ſo conſequently for true juſtification? for he that doth thus keep the Law, ſhall live thereby, as I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 5. But the heathen ſpiritual Chriſtians do thus keep the law by faith; for it is Propheſied of them, <hi>That in the dayes of the Meſſiah, they ſhall offer ſacrifices of a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, than thoſe that were offered by the Jews under the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46. 5, 11. and this they muſt do by faith, by looking from the carnal types to the ſpiritual things that are typified thereby: And in this reſpect, it is the prayer of all the godly in all Nations, that they may be ſound in Gods Statutes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 80, 112. which cannot bee till they have faith to look to the end of thoſe things, which is typified by the righteouſneſs of thoſe Ordinances and Statutes.</p>

                     <p>12 As the word <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> ſo the word <hi>Law</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 4. and the word <hi>Law</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4.

                     </p>
                     <p>1 I beleeve that I have already ſufficiently put the matter out of controverſie, that the Jews legal juſtifications by their waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſacrifices, did relate to his Death and Sacrifice as the end of them all, as I ſhewed from <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. and it is further evident by <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. there redeeming us from iniquity, and purifying by Gods Attonement, is put together as cauſe and effect; and thus Chriſt is the end of the Law for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And I find that the word <hi>Law</hi> in the New Teſtament, as well as the Old, is to be underſtood chiefly of the Ceremonial Laws; it is uſed thirteen times in the Epiſtle to the Hebrews,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:64895:152"/>
and in all thoſe places, except once, it muſt bee underſtood of the Ceremonial Laws; and ſo it is often uſed in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> and moſt for the Law of Rites, or for the whole Oeconomy of <hi>Moſes,</hi> having reſpect wholly to the Law of Rites.</p>
                     <p>13 It is alſo worthy of all due obſervation, that none of their legal juſtifications did juſtifie them by any actual kind of purity put upon their fleſh, that ſo it might bee imputed to them for their juſtification, but their righteouſneſs was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to them by Gods poſitive Ordinance, even by a paſſive purity only, by waſhing and purging away their Ceremonial ſins, and ſo by the blood of Buls procuring Gods attonement thereby for their Ceremonial ſins, for blood doth not cleanſe otherwiſe but by procuring Gods attonement and forgiveneſs; Blood materially conſidered doth not waſh, but defile the fleſh, but formally conſidered, as it was ordained by Gods poſitive Law, to be a ſacrifice for the procuring of Gods Reconciliation, ſo only it hath a cleanſing quality, and accordingly it pleaſed God by his voluntary poſitive Law and Covenant, to ordain that the blood of Chriſt ſhould much more cleanſe our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience from dead works, becauſe it was ordained to be the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoriou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And this is that righteouſneſs of ſinners that is ſo much ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, and typified in the Law; and therefore this kind of language touching a ſinners righteouſneſs, though it may ſeem ſtrange to ſome, yet it needs not ſeem ſtrange to any, that are but meanly acquainted with the language of the Ceremonial Types, whcih is our School-maſter to Chriſt.</p>

God opened his eyes to ſee his ſinful condition, by the ſpiritual application of the Law to his conſcience, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. and then from the typical, he ſaw his inward juſtification.</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly, This is worth marking, as I mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that in their legal juſtification, no actual holineſs was put upon them, but onely their ceremonial ſins of uncleanneſs were purged from them, and that was their juſtice or juſtification, when they ſtood before him in his Sanctuary, for it is ſaid, <hi>That the blood of Buls and Goats, and the aſhes of an Heifer ſprinkling the unclean, did ſanctifie to the purifying of the fleſh;</hi> but that kind of ſanctification was obtained by their ceremonial purifyings, which did procure Gods attonement in forgiving ſin, and no other Sanctification was ordained for their legal Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Natural Philoſophers, ſaith <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> cannot be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the abſolution of God procured by ſacrifice did make men righteous, and therefore they did not call it our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; <note place="margin">P. <hi>Martyr</hi> ſpake theſe words in his laſt expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and therefore though his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what differ, it is not ſo much to be ſtood on, as on what he ſaith here in his laſt meditations.</note> but you may ſee that <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> held (according to the ceremonial types) that the pacifying of God, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of his attonement by the ſacrifice of Chriſt, is a ſinners righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>I ſay, this way of juſtification God was pleaſed to ordaine by his voluntary poſitive Law and Covenant with Chriſt, which was alſo typified by his poſitive Covenant of Works, with the Jews.</p>

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 5. Every mean perſon knows, that the Heavens, and ſuch like unreaſonable Creatures, are a ſubject that is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of forgiveneſs, becauſe they are not capable of ſin in a proper ſenſe, and therefore alſo they are not capable of this kind of righteouſneſs: But the Dialogue ſpeaks only of ſinners that are reaſonable creatures; yea, and of ſuch ſinners as are in Chriſt; and therefore it ſpeaks of ſuch creatures as are capable of pardon, and ſo they are fit ſubjects of being made righteous by pardon.</p>
                     <p>But Secondly, Why cannot pardon compleat righteouſneſs? hath not God a ſupreme power by his voluntary Law and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, to make it a ſinners formal righteouſneſs, as well as he had to conſtitute a fruit tree (which he called the Tree of Life) to confirm <hi>Adam</hi> in his created perfections, if he had but once eaten thereof? We muſt not look to what is a perfect righteouſneſs to our ſenſes; but we muſt look to Gods poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Ordinance; he could tell how to ordain ſuch a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as will beſt fit ſinners.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, We ſee alſo, that by his own voluntary Ordinance, he made unreaſonable creatures that are not guilty of moral ſins, to be guilty of ceremonial ſins, and to be capable alſo of ceremonial juſtification, as I inſtanced afore of the Temple, it was firſt polluted by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and it was afterwards juſtified by ſanctified Prieſts, in carrying out the filth thereof, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 14.

Yea, the matter of mans body, and the form of Angels, may be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to do ſervice to man, and yet not be but one perſon, but may continue ſtill to be both diſtinct matter without form, and form without matter; As for example, when the Angels aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med bodies, it was not to give that matter any natural form, but it was a miraculous union, onely for their preſent mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry to men: And hence you ſee that the matter of mans body and the form of Angels may be united, and yet remain two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct things.</p>

Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in his Aphoriſms, p. 213. enumerating the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſaith, that a material cauſe properly it hath none; If, ſaith he, you will improperly call Chriſts ſatisfaction the remote matter, I contend not.

                        <hi>Reply 7.</hi> 1 The ſtile of the Dialogue is borrowed very much from the types of the ceremonial Law, which were ordained to be our School-maſter to Chriſt; and I beleeve, if more pains were taken to expreſs the point of ſatisfaction, and the point of juſtification, in that ſtile, it would be much for the clearing of the truth.</p>
                     <p>2 It ſeems that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> will have no other righteouſneſs
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:64895:156"/>
for a ſinners formal righteouſneſs, but Chriſts moral righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs imputed; for he makes the Fathers righteouſneſs in being attoned to ſinners, of no account in the formal cauſe; But, ſaith Mr. <hi>Boxter</hi> in his Apology to Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> p. 24. It muſt be known, that the righteouſneſs given us, is not the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whereby Chriſts perſon was righteous (for accidents periſh being removed from their ſubject) but it is a righteouſneſs merited, by Chriſts ſatisfaction and obedience, for us: And that can be no other, ſay I, but a paſſive righteouſneſs by Gods merciful attonement in not imputing ſin, as I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified it from the types of Gods poſitive Statutes and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</p>
                     <p>3. I have already ſhewed, and I think it needful to repeat it again. Firſt, That it was Chriſts ſatisfactory Righteouſneſs to perform the Covenant on his part by his death and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And ſecondly, That it was Gods Righteouſneſs to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Covenant on his part, which was, to be reconciled to ſinners, by not imputing their ſins to them, as ſoon as they are in Chriſt by faith; The meritorious righteouſneſs of the death and ſufferings of Chriſts combate with Satan, performed on his part, did bind God to perform his ſaid Reconciliation on his part; and both theſe Righteouſneſſes, together with the performance of the Covenant on the part of the Holy Ghoſt, which was to proceed from the Father and the Son, to convert ſinners, and to unite them to Chriſts, that ſo they might be fit ſubjects for the ſaid righteouſneſs; I ſay, this voluntary, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocial Covenant between the Trinity, doth conſtitute all the cauſes of a ſinners righteouſneſs; and in particular, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant on the Fathers part doth conſtitute the formal part of it. This poſitive created Righteouſneſs was unknown to natural Philoſophers, it is not framed from the moral Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but it is a Righteouſneſs for ſinners, created on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by the voluntary poſitive Law and Covenant of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                     <p>4. I cannot but wonder that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſhould ſo much plead for the moral righteouſneſs of Chriſt to be the matter, and the imputation of it to be the form of our righteouſneſs; ſeeing it did not formally conſtitute <hi>Adams</hi> righteouſneſs, as Mr. <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> himſelf doth alſo acknowledge, in p. 261. and Mr. <hi>Burges</hi> on
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:64895:156"/>
Juſtification, p. 8. and indeed the reaſon thereof is very plain, becauſe God required that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould firſt eate of the tree of life, as the meritorious cauſe for procuring the formality of his moral perfections, and this tree had this efficacy from Gods voluntary poſitive Covenant with <hi>Adam.</hi> As I have ſhewed more large already, chap. 2.</p>
                     <p>The Dialogue ſaith, that ſinners in themſelves, namely, as long as they continue to be ſinners, which is as long as they live in this body of ſin, can have no other righteouſneſs than a paſſive righteouſneſs, proceeding from Gods merciful attonement, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and forgiveneſs.</p>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> in p. 231. leaves out theſe words <hi>[in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves]</hi> and then makes a falſe Argument of the Dialogues ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>But I dare ſay, no judicious Chriſtian, that will but make through ſearch into all the types of legal Juſtification, ſhall find any other way of making ſinners righteous, but by Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Reconciliation in not imputing ſin. Reckon up the legal terms, by which Attonement is expreſſed, and that will juſtifie what I ſay; as by expiating ſin, not imputing ſin, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully forgiving ſin, purging ſin, purifying, waſhing, cleanſing ſin, to the ſanctifying the fleſh; theſe, and ſuch like are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly uſed in the Law; but never any for making righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous by imputing moral righteouſneſs, which doubtleſs would have been ordained to typifie the imputation of Chriſts moral righteouſneſs in the formal cauſe of Juſtification, if any ſuch thing had been intended for the only formal cauſe.</p>
                     <p>5. It ſeems to me, that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth wilfully ſtumble at the ſtile of the Dialogue, becauſe it makes a ſinners righteouſneſs to be procured by Chriſts ſacrifice of Attonement; but any one may ſee that this phraſe, the Sacrifice of Attonement, (at which he ſtumbles) is a uſual Scripture phraſe, for the publick yearly Sin-Offering is called the Sin of Attonements, <hi>Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And all Sacrifices were ordained by Gods voluntary Covenant, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Gods Attonement, and Juſtification from all their legal ſins; even peace-Offerings were ſometimes offered to procure
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:64895:157"/>
peace by Gods attonement, and in relation to their typical uſe, the ſacrifice of Chriſt may well be called a Sacrifice of Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Reconciliation or Attonement deſcribed both in the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious &amp; formal cauſes.</note> for the procuring of Gods attonement for all our moral ſins, and ſo conſequently for our moral juſtification; and this is moſt cleer, becauſe the Apoſtle doth define Gods reconciliation to ſinners, by his not imputing their ſins to them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. for as long as ſin is imputed it makes a jar between God and the ſinner; but when God doth not impute ſin, then there is no more jar, but reconciliation with God: And therefore the ſin of Attonement, which was offered on Reconciliation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, is called by the Septuagint, the Purgation of ſins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it procured Gods Attonement, by which only ſin is purged away, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 10. and this place the Apoſtle applies to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. namely, as it is the meritorious cauſe of Gods reconciliation, whereby our ſins are fully purged.</p>
                     <p>The Hebrew word for Reconciliation doth ſignifie to cover, pacifie, or appeaſe, noting thereby the meritorious cauſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 32. 20.</note> 32. 20. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 14. and to bee pacified, doth note the formal cauſe; It doth alſo ſignifie to ſatisfie, or recompence, noting thereby the meritorious cauſe, 2 <hi>Sam. 21. 3. Exod. 21. 30. Pſal. 49. 8. Gen.</hi> 31. 29. and to bee ſatisfied, doth note the formal cauſe of Reconciliation, as in <hi>Mat. 3. 17. This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed, ſatisfied or reconciled;</hi> and ſo in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. 1, 2. <hi>Lord, thou haſt been favourable, or well-pleaſed with thy land, Thou haſt forgiven the iniquities of thy people, and covered all their ſin;</hi> Theſe three ſeveral phraſes are <hi>Synonimas,</hi> and do ſet out the formal cauſe of Reconciliation or Juſtification; but whether the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt is to be underſtood of outward or inward Reconciliation, needs not now to be diſputed, becauſe the outward is but an exemplification of the inward.</p>
                     <p>And hence it follows, that Chriſts ſacrifice may well bee ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Sacrifice of Attonement, becauſe it was exemplified by the legal ſacrifices of Attonement, and becauſe it was ordained to procure Gods Attonement; and in this reſpect alſo all Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Attonement, are called Sacrifices of Righteouſneſs, <note place="margin">Deut. 33. 19.

                     <p n="2">2 His receiving into favour, or both theſe may bee joyned into one, namely, Gods gracious pardon; and all this is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Chriſts ſacrifice, for it is for his ſacrifice ſake that God the Father doth abſolve or acquit a beleeving ſinner that is in Chriſt, from the guilt of all his ſins, and ſo receives him into favour by adoption; or thus, Gods Attonement for the ſake of Chriſts Sacrifice, is not a bare legal forgiveneſs, as when a Judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits a Malefactor, and ſo leaves him; but it is a gracious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital, as when a Father forgives his Son, and receives him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to favour.</p>
                     <p>And this truth the Dialogue doth fully expreſs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth argue ſophiſtically and abſurdly againſt the rules of Logick, and his own conſcience; for hee knows that in his antecedent, this phraſe <hi>[By Chriſts Sacrifice of Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment]</hi> is meant both of the cauſe and effect; Chriſts ſacrifice being the cauſe, and Gods attonement the effect; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing the ſacrifice of Chriſt is all along ſo plainly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Dialogue, to be the only meriting cauſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, namely, of Gods attonement, for a ſinners righteouſneſs or juſtification, It follows, that the conſequence which Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> draws from it, <hi>viz.</hi> neither then can attonement bee a ſinners righteouſneſs, is a ſenſeleſs <hi>non ſequitur.</hi>

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 9. This expoſition of the word Attonement, may (I conceive) miſ-lead the Reader as well as himſelf, becauſe hee reſtrains it to Pitch, or ſuch like tenacious matter that cannot be taken off again, and therefore I will open the uſe of the word for the advantage of the Readers.</p>

Even ſo it was Gods poſitive Law and Covenant, that made the death and ſacrifice of Chriſt to be the <note place="margin">2 King. 21. 3.</note> full price to cover Gods angry face, or to attone him for the ranſom of the many, <hi>Mat. 20. 28. 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 6. <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 6.</note>

Neh.</hi> 10. 32, 33. but in <hi>Exo.</hi> 30. 16. is called attonement mony, and by ſome Tranſlations redemption-mony, becauſe redemption is obtained by procuring Gods attonement; and hence we may ſee the reaſon why we are ſaid to be <hi>bought with a price, 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 20. and why the blood of Chriſt is called a price, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18, 19. the phraſe of <hi>a price</hi> given to the Sacrifice, and ſo to Chriſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:64895:159"/>
is borrowed from the price that God appointed them to pay for the redemption of their lives, and for the buying of ſacrifices of attonement, for the procuring of Gods attonement for the redemption of their lives, and ſo for their juſtification in his ſight.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>Caphar</hi> is uſed for the covering of Gods angry ſace from moral ſins that defile the Land, by executing impartial Juſtice upon Malefactors; And thus <hi>Phineas,</hi> when he executed juſtice on the Fornicators, did by that means (cover Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry face, or) make attonement for the Sons of <hi>Iſrael, Numb.</hi> 25. 17. In like ſort, when Gods angry face had been upon the Land by a three years famine, for <hi>Sauls</hi> bloody ſin, in ſlaying the innocent <hi>Gibbeonites: Then</hi> David <hi>ſaid to the</hi> Gibbeonites, <hi>wherewith ſhall I</hi> (cover Gods angry face, or) <hi>make attonement, that ye may bleſs the inheritance of the Lord,</hi> 2 Sam. 21. 3.

                     <p>It is alſo ſaid in <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. 33. Blood polluteth the Land, and there ſhall be no (covering of my anger, or) attonement made for the Land, but by the blood of him that ſhed it; and in caſe of a ſecret murderer, yet by Gods Ordinance the Land was guilty, till the Elders of the people had made attonement by the death of a Bullock, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 8.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, <hi>Caphar</hi> is uſed for the covering of Gods angry face from ceremonial ſins, by typical Sacrifices of Attonement, and from the moral ſins of our ſouls, by the true ſacrifice of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And this kind of covering by Attonement doth alwaies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note Gods forgiveneſs and receiving into favor, as <hi>Lev. 4. 20, 26, 31, 35. Lev.</hi> 5. 6, 10, 13, 16, 18. And ſometimes it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by making clean, as in <hi>Numb. 8. 21. Lev.</hi> 16. 30.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 20. ſaith, This word <hi>Caphar</hi> is often uſed in the Law for covering or taking away offences, and for pacifying anger by gifts, and ſo making Attonement, as in <hi>Exod. 29 36. Levit. 14, 20, 26. and 5. 6, 10, 13. Deut.</hi> 21. 8. And ſaith he, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. 4. Our treſpaſſes thou wilt mercifully cover them, namely, expiate, propitiate, purge away, and ſo merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully cover and forgive them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="258" facs="tcp:64895:160"/>
And, ſaith he, the Hebrew <hi>Caphar</hi> ſignifies to cover; and ſaith he, the cover of the Ark was called <hi>Caporeth, Exod.</hi> 25. 17. in Greek <hi>Hilaſterion,</hi> That is, the propitiatory or Mercy-Seat, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. 5. which name <hi>Paul</hi> giveth to Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. and <hi>he is the true propitiation for our ſins,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 2. And ſaith he, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 38. He being compaſſionate mercifully covered iniquity. And ſaith he, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79. 9. mercifully cover our ſins; he doth moſt fitly add the word <hi>merciful,</hi> to the word <hi>cover;</hi> becauſe <hi>Caporeth</hi> is applied to the cover of the Ark, called Gods Mercy-Seat, where he uſed to appear and to manifeſt his favor, by the cloud of his preſence, when he was attoned to his people, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 2. and ſo the word Merciful, or propitious, is added to Gods forgiving the ſins of his people, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 12. and ſuch as confeſs their ſins have the promiſe of Gods mercy, namely, of his merciful pardon, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 13. By theſe, and ſuch like conſiderations, we may ſee the reaſon why <hi>David</hi> uſeth this phraſe, <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſin is covered, Pſal.</hi> 32. 1. namely, by Gods gracious forgiveneſs, for the ſake of Chriſts propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>The uſe of the burnt offering, ſaith <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Gods attonement or rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſſion of ſins, as it is evident, ſaith he, by <hi>Job</hi> 42. 8. and ſo (ſaith he) the anger of God is (covered, or) appeaſed by the burnt offering of Chriſts, for he is the attonement or reconciliation for our ſins, <hi>Dan. 9. 24. 1 Joh. 2. 2. Heb.</hi> 10. 8 10.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, After I had penned theſe meditations on the word Attonement, I met with another excellent explanation of it in our larger Annotations, in 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 6. 49. The Reader may pleaſe to confer that note with theſe meditations.</p>
                     <p>Ninethly, It is alſo worth the marking, that the Seventy do render the Hebrew word <hi>Caphar,</hi> in various expreſſions. Some of them I will name.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Seventy do render the word <hi>Caphar</hi> to <hi>ſanctifie,</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 33. There our Tranſlation ſaith thus, <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons ſhall <hi>

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>at thoſe things by which attonement was made;</hi> But the Seventy ſay, <hi>by which they were ſanctified.</hi> And ſo in ver. 36. our tranſlation ſaith thus, <hi>Thou ſhalt offer every day a Bullock for a ſin of Attonement;</hi> The Seventy ſay, <hi>for a ſin, by which they ſhall be ſanctified;</hi> But I have opened this word ſanctified before, in
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:64895:160"/>
Reply 3. And ſo it is ſaid in <hi>Heb. 9. 13. That the blood of Bulls and Goats, and the aſhes of an Heifer ſprinkling the unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh,</hi> for their legal Juſtification before God in his Sanctuary.</p>
                     <p>But when Chriſt came into the world he took away theſe legal ſanctifications, and theſe bodily juſtifications, by the blood of Bulls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and according to Gods will he eſtabliſhed his own Sacrifice in the place of them; <hi>by which will,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>we are ſanctified,</hi> namely, by Gods attonement and forgiveneſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10, 14. that is to ſay, we are juſtified from our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſins, through the offering of the body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all.</p>
                     <p>This expoſition of the word <hi>Caphar,</hi> which is uſed to ſet out Gods covering of ſin by his attonement, is by the Seventy tranſlated ſanctified, and therefore it doth force us to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice (but that we are dull of hearing) that a ſinners righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in Gods ſight doth ſtand in being ſanctified or made ſinleſs by Gods attonement and forgiveneſs; This kind of ſanctification is our onely juſtification in Gods ſight; For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the underſtanding of the Seventy Interpreters, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar,</hi> the covering of ſin by Gods attonement, did denominate the Jews to be legally ſanctified to the purifying of their fleſh, becauſe by Gods attonement their impurity was removed, without putting any active purity upon their fleſh, by any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Ordinance.</p>
                     <p>This kind of ſanctification therefore was a lively type of our moral juſtification, both by the meritorious cauſe of Chriſts Sacrifice, and by the formal cauſe of Gods Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Seventy do render <hi>Caphar,</hi> to cleanſe, as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 37. and in <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 10.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They render it to purge, in <hi>Deut. 32. 43. Exod. 30. 10. Iſa.</hi> 60. 7. and theſe three differing expreſſions do but explain the former word Attonement, in our Tranſlations, for in <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 33, 36. it is in the ſame verſes, it is alſo explained by the word ſanctified, as <hi>Synonimas</hi> to <hi>Caphar,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By theſe and ſuch like terms given by the Seventy to <hi>Caphar,</hi> it is evident, that they underſtood, that when Gods angry face was attoned by ſacrifice, in relation to their ceremonial ſins,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:64895:161"/>
that they were thereby ſanctified, to the purifying of their fleſh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13. and that thereby their perſons were juſtified in reſpect of their appearing before Gods preſence in his Sanctuary, or in regard of feaſting with him on the holy fleſh of the Paſſeover, or Peace-offerings; and in this reſpect they called ſuch clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 1, 10.</note> juſtifications of divine Service, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 1. and carnal juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, in v. 10. <hi>viz.</hi> Ceremonial, Ritual, and Typical, as Mr. <hi>Trap</hi> expounds it, or the righteouſneſs of the fleſh, as I have more largely opened the matter a little before; and ſo alſo when the Temple was ceremonially purged from the polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> it is ſaid in the Seventy, to be cleanſed, but in the Hebrew Text it is ſaid to be juſtified, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 14. <note place="margin">Dan. 8. 14.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence it follows by an unavoidable conſequence, that their legal Ordinances by which they obtained Gods attonement, for their legal cleanſings, fanctifyings, and juſtifyings, and for their legal righteouſneſs, did typifie and exemplifie how ſinners are cleanſed, waſhed, ſanctified and juſtified, as it is expreſſed by theſe terms in 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 6. 11. and how they are made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous by the righteouſneſs of the Law, as it is in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 26. and in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 4. namely, becauſe the ſacrifice of Chriſt is the fulfilling and end of all ſacrifices, and of all other legal cleanſings, and therefore it is the onely meritorious and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring cauſe of Gods attonement and forgiveneſs, for the formal cleanſing, waſhing, ſanctifying, and juſtifying the conſcience, from the accuſing and condemning power of all moral ſins, by which means we may ſtand before God as juſtified perſons in his ſight, when we come to put up our requeſts unto him, or to feaſt with him at the Lords Table; for when we come to the Lords Table, Gods forgiveneſs is the greateſt and moſt precious dainty, for which Chriſt ſhed his blood; and therefore, at his laſt Supper he ſaid thus to his Diſciples, <hi>This is my blood of the New Teſtament which is ſhed for the many, for the remiſſion of ſins, Mat.</hi> 26. 28. according as it was promiſed in <hi>Dan</hi> 9. 24. this dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Gods forgiveneſs, is the great purchaſe of Chriſts blood, which makes them bleſſed that have it, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 32. 1. and makes them eternally righteous in Gods ſight that have it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. This, and a new heart, are the two great legacies of the new Covenant, <hi>Jer. 31. Heb.</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things thus opened (me thinks) ſhould ſo enlighten the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:64895:161"/>

                     <p>And thus have I in ſome meaſure opened this phraſe, <hi>The Righteouſneſs of God, by his Reconciliation or Attonement;</hi> and I have opened the word <hi>Attonement,</hi> both in the meritorious and in the formal cauſes; namely, that Sacrifices for ſin did meritoriouſly cover Gods angry face, attone, pacifie, reconcile, expiate, propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate, purge, ſanctifie, cleanſe, and purifie, or make righteous a ſinner, by procuring Gods attonement for his formal reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, righteouſneſs, and juſtification.</p>
                     <p>And now methinks Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> may do well to conſider his unadviſedneſs in villifying this kind of attonement. And 2.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply</hi> 1. Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth exceedingly abuſe the Apoſtles meaning, to ſay that his <hi>minor</hi> is the Apoſtles, and alſo in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Apoſtle doth cite <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23. to prove that our Redemption by Chriſt is both held forth and foretold there.</p>
                  <p>But for the better finding out of the Apoſtles meaning in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
                  <p>There are two diſtinct clauſes in the fomer part of the verſe that are of neceſſity to be well marked.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 That Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law.</item>
                     <item>2 That he was made a curſe for us.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Theſe two clauſes the Dialogue hath expreſſed thus.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law.</item>
                     <item>2 When he was made a curſe for us.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Now ſaith the Dialogue, the Apoſtle cites <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23. only to prove the laſt clauſe, namely, That Chriſt was made a curſe for us in the outward manner of his death, like unto other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Malefactors, even at the ſame time when he redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med us from the curſe of the Law, by making the formality of his death to bee a ſacrifice, by his own Prieſtly power.</p>
                  <p>2 It is further evident, that this ſenſe is the truth, by the prediction of it from the time of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. Thou Sathan ſhalt pierce him as a ſinful Malefactor on the Tree, and yet hee ſhall break thy Head-plot at the very ſame time, by his <note place="margin">The outward manner of Chriſts death on the Tree, was firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in Gen. 3. 15.</note> obedience to the death; for in all his conflict with thy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious torturing pains on the Croſs, he ſhall not ſuffer his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to bee diſturbed, nor his obedience to bee perverted, but hee ſhall continue obedient to the death, even the death of the Croſs; and in that obedience, as ſoon as thou haſt done thy worſt to diſturb it, and as ſoon as hee hath finiſhed all his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, hee ſhall make his death a ſacrifice by his own Prieſtly power; And it is recorded of him, that as ſoon as he had but ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> he bowed his head, and gave up the Ghoſt, and that was the formality both of his death and ſufferings; And thus hee brake the Devils Head-plot, had the victory
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:64895:163"/>
and won the prize which was the redemption of all the Elect, even at the ſame time when hee was put to death, as a curſed Malefactor, by the Devil, in hanging on a Tree.</p>
                  <p>This was the declared platform of the Trinity according to their eternal Covenant for mans Redemption, as I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed it in the Dialogue, but have often in this book ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and inlarged it.</p>
                  <p>3 It is worth the marking, that the Apoſtle doth not put the Article <hi>The,</hi> to the word <hi>Curſe,</hi> cited from <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23. but only to the firſt word <hi>Curſe,</hi> as it is cited in verſe 10. from <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. But in caſe the latter word Curſe had included the moral Curſe, as well as the former word <hi>Curſe,</hi> then in reaſon it ſhould have had the Article <hi>[The]</hi> put to it, as wel as it is to the former; but becauſe it is not put to the latter, therefore this may ſerve as another Argument to prove the Apoſtle meant that Chriſt ſuffered no other Curſe, but ſuch a Curſe as his proof meant, namely, a curſed death in the outward manner of it, juſt like unto thoſe Malefactors that were hanged on a Tree, according to <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. And to this ſenſe doth <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Theephilact</hi> expound the Curſe that Chriſt ſuffered, cited in the former Chapter, namely, that he ſuffered on a Tree as if he had been a ſinner, for he was put to death as a ſinner by the Devils imputation, but not by Gods imputation; if hee had ſuffered as a ſinner from Gods immediate wrath, and by Gods imputation, then hee muſt ſome way or other have had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with our guilt; For (ſaith <hi>Grotius</hi> afore cited) merit is perſonal; and therefore when the Ancient Divines ſay, Hee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered on a Tree, as if he had been a ſinner, they mean it only in reſpect of the likeneſs of his puniſhments unto other curſed Malefactors, which puniſhment an innocent perſon may ſuffer as well as a Malefactor: And ſo <hi>Auſtin</hi> (ſaith well) that Chriſt received our puniſhment without ſin, that thereby hee might diſſolve our ſin, and end our puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>And in relation to this ſenſe the Dialogue doth open the Apoſtles words thus, Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, even at the ſame time <hi>[When]</hi> hee was made (not that Curſe in verſe 10. But) a curſe for us, according to <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23.</p>

with the Dialogue, from no other cauſe, but becauſe the word <hi>When</hi> doth utterly ſpoyl the viſage of the Argument, for it is no way ſuitable to his typical ſenſe, on which the foundation of his Argument doth depend, and therefore it is no marvel, that he doth cenſure the Dialogue for putting it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Text.</p>

                     <hi>Reply</hi> 6. The Dialogue hath given a probable reaſon, yea a certain reaſon, why the Malefactor that was hanged upon a tree, was infamed with a greater curſe than any other <note place="margin">Stoning to death was counted the heavieſt kind of death of all deaths, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the infamy of hanging up the dead body to be gazed on, for their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reproach, for the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the dead body was uſually annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtoning to death.</note> death.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Saith the Dialogue in page 68. Not every ſinner that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved death by <hi>[Thou]</hi> the Sanhedrim is meant of this high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of curſe in their death, but ſuch ſinners only as deſerved to have their bodies hanged on a tree after they were ſtoned to death; for God had given power to the Sanhedrim when they ſtoned Malefactors to death, if the circumſtances of their ſin were of a high conſideration, to hang up their dead bodies on a tree, for their greater reproach, ſhame, and ignominy, and to be a ſpectacle to others, as long as the Sun gave light, but yet in any wiſe to bury him that day, and thus <hi>Calvin</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 21. and <hi>Goodwin</hi> on <hi>Moſes</hi> Rites, and Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 22. do accord with the Dialogue that hanging is for the greater curſe after ſtoning to death.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Saith the Dialogue, the rebellious Son in <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 21. is brought as an inſtance of this double puniſhment.</p>

                  <p>And then ſecondly, His dead body was hanged on a tree to be gazed on for his further reproach and inſamy, and ſo for a higher degree of curſe than his ſtoning to death was; and from this particular inſtance, <hi>Moſes</hi> doth infer in verſ. 22. <hi>That if there be in a man</hi> (that is to ſay in any other man beſides the Rebellious Son) <hi>a ſin</hi> (that is to ſay, any other capital ſin) <hi>that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or in caſe they were hanged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, according to the <hi>Roman</hi> manner, and left hanging a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time after their death to be a gazing ſtock, a by-word, and a reproach, then that made that kind of death to be an accurſed death above all other kinds of death; For to be under the ſhame and reproach of men is a great curſe of God; and therefore ſhame, reproach, taunts, by-words, and curſes, are all joyned together, as terms Synonimas, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 24. 9. in <hi>Jer.</hi> 42. 18. in <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 8, 12. And for an innocent to bear theſe ignominious curſes, it muſt needs be a very dreadful thing to the outward man, though his innocency may bear up his inward man, as it doth in Martyrs, and as it did in Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Devil, by Gods declared permiſſion, had power to put Chriſt to this ignominious, and long lingring violent death, as it is expreſſed, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. therefore it was Gods will that Chriſt ſhould be ſenſible of it in the affections of his ſoul, and in that reſpect his humane nature was often much troubled at the conſideration of it, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 7. There Chriſt ſaith thus, <hi>For thy ſake have I born reproach, ſhame hath covered my face:</hi> It was thy declared will and command, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. that I ſhould combate with Satan, with mans true nature and affections, and that he ſhould have power to uſe me as a malefactor, with the greateſt ignominy that he could invent, and at laſt peirce me in the foot-ſoals, as a moſt ignominious malefactor, on the tree; and I muſt be ſenſible of all this, as I am true man, of the ſeed of the woman.

And his ſuffering on the croſs without the gate is called <hi>His reproach, Heb.</hi> 13. 13. and reproach is a dreadful thing to the Saints, and therefore they pray in <hi>Pſal. 119. 22.

                  </p>
                  <p>And we ſee by experience, that men do account the ſhame of death to be worſe than the pains of death, and therefore <hi>Saul</hi> deſired his Armor-bearer, rather to kill him, than the Philiſtims ſhould come and mock him at his death, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31. 4. and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimeleck</hi> willed his Armor-bearer to kill him, rather than men ſhould ſay, to his greater ſhame, that a woman had killed him, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5. 54. for the more ſhame, the more curſe of God is in any death. And the cuſtom among the Jews was not to put male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors to death by hanging, but they uſed to hang up the dead body after it was ſtoned to death, for the greater infamy to the ſin and ſinner; therefore hanging among them was not uſed to denote the curſe in reſpect of the pains of death, but onely to ſet forth the curſe of ſhame and reproach, and therefore hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among them could not be a type of the pains of the eternal curſe.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, It was the cuſtom of the <hi>Romans</hi> to put the baſeſt ſort of Malefactors to death by hanging, and after death to let them hang for a time to be a ſpectacle of ignominy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preach, and therefore the pains of death was in that curſe,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:64895:166"/>
though, chiefly, the ſhame is intended by the Apoſtle in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. becauſe it relates to the curſe of hanging in <hi>Deut. 21. 23. mortis modus morte pejor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the Hebrew Doctors ſay, they bewailed not him that went to be executed, but onely mourned inwardly for him; they bewailed him not that (ſo ſay they) his diſgrace might be his expiation; they it ſeems, accounted that the more ſhame and puniſhment a condemned perſon ſuffered, the more it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the expiation of his ſin from the Land. See Dr. <hi>Lightfoots</hi> Harmony on the New Teſtament, p. 71. And Chriſt told his Diſciples of the ignominiouſneſs of his death by the <hi>Romans,</hi> that <hi>the Prieſts and Scribes ſhould deliver him to the Gentiles, to mock, and to ſcourge, and to crucifie him.</hi> And the ſtory of the Evangeliſts doth at large ſet forth the greatneſs of the curſe that was in his death, by mockings and revilings.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 They mocked his Prophetical Office, ſaying, <hi>Prophecy who it is that ſomte thee,</hi> Mat. 26 68.</item>
                     <item>2 They ſcoffed his Prieſtly Office, ſaying, <hi>He ſaved others, himſelf he cannot ſave,</hi> Mat. 27. 42.</item>
                     <item>3 They mocked his Kingly Office, ſaying, <hi>Hail King of the Jews,</hi> Mat. 27. 28. and ſaid, <hi>They had no King but</hi> Caeſar, Joh. 19. 15.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Theſe, and ſuch like expreſſions, do ſet out the ſcandal of his croſs, and ſo the greatneſs of the curſe, which Satan with all his might did multiply in a tranſcendent manner upon him, if by any means he could diſturb his patience, and ſo pervert him in the courſe of his obedience, that ſo his death might not be a ſacrifice, and then Satan had got the victory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but becauſe Chriſt continued obedient to the death, even to the death of the croſs, and at laſt made his ſoul a ſacrifice by his own Prieſtly power, therefore he broke the Devils head, and got the victory, and ſo he won the prize.</p>
                  <p>And thus have I given a ſufficient reaſon why thoſe that were hanged on a tree were infamed with a greater curſe of reproach than was by any other ſort of capital death that was in uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <head>For Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſaith, <hi>That in caſe the body that was hanged, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue unburied till after Sun-ſet, it cauſed the whole land to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ceremonially.</hi>

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 7. The time of the burial of the perſon hanged is not (by the Text, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23.) limited to ſun-ſet, as Mr <hi>Norton</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The time of the burial of the perſon hanged might be after ſun-ſet provided it were done within the compaſs of the ſame natural day which laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.</note> doth wreſt the words of the Text to ſpeak; But the time limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Text is this, <hi>He ſhall not hang all night upon the tree, but thou ſhalt bury him the ſame day;</hi> Mark the phraſe, <hi>He ſhall not hang all night;</hi> Hence it follows, that he might hang ſome part of the night, ſo he did not hang all night; that is to ſay, he might hang ſome part of the night, provided they did bury him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits of the ſame natural day, for the words of the Text are thus, <hi>He ſhall not hang all night, but thou ſhalt bury him the ſame day:</hi> And I have at large ſhewed in my Treatiſe of <hi>Holy Time,</hi> that the ſame natural day was not ended till midnight, and ſee more in Sect. 8. In like ſort, the Peace-offerings were commanded to be eaten the ſame day, in which they were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 15. and yet they might be eaten after ſun-ſet, as the ſpeech of the Harlot doth ſhew, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 9. and for this ſee <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 15, 18. and in <hi>Lev.</hi> 22. 30. <note place="margin">Prov. 7. 9.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, in this particular caſe of hanging, we ſee that <hi>Joſhua</hi> did permit the King of <hi>Ai</hi> to continue hanging on the tree until the Sun was down. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 8. 29. and therefore ſeeing he did not command his carkaſs to be taken down from the tree un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till <note place="margin">Joſh. 8. 29.</note> the ſun was ſet, it follows, that his carkaſs could not be buried before ſun-ſet. And thus his crutch is fallen, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all his concluſions that are built thereon are fallen with it, sa his language is to me.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Though Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> do cite <hi>Junius</hi> to his typical ſenſe, yet I find by conference, that <hi>Junius</hi> not many lines before thoſe words cited by Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> doth plainly deny that the carkaſs <note place="margin">See <hi>Junius</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel. l. 2. paral. 51.</note> thus hanged did defile the land, although it remained unburied after ſun-ſet; he doth rather place the defiling of the land in the act of the Judges, in caſe they ſuffered the carkaſs to continue unburied that day, after the juſtice of the Law was ſatisfied
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:64895:167"/>
(which was ordinarily ſatisfied with that days infamy) and to this purpoſe alſo doth the Geneva note ſpeak. But I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently produce another reaſon why the Judges were exhorted not to defile the land.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It is very probable by his words, in pag. 102. that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth ſteer his judgement in this point, <hi>of defiting the Land,</hi> by following the ſenſe of a corrupt Tranſlation; I mean by following the latter Editions of King <hi>Jameſes</hi> Tranſlation; <note place="margin">The latter E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of King <hi>Jameſes</hi> Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Deut. 21. 23. is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted from the integrity of the firſt Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> for the latter Editions are corrupted from the integrity of the firſt Editions. It is moſt likely that ſome left-handed perſon (that happily was of Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> judgement) did venture too boldly to alter the Tranſlation from the integrity of the firſt Editions, for the firſt Editions, both the Church Bible, and ſome others do run thus, <hi>His body ſhall not remain all night upon the tree: But thou ſhalt in any wiſe bury him that day, for he that is hanged is accurſed of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the end of this ſentence <hi>[He that is hanged is accurſed of God]</hi> they ſet a colon, or two pricks; And then follows ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtinct ſentence, thus,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That thy Land be not defiled.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in the latter Editions, there is a great corruption made, for firſt, The colon is omitted. And ſecondly, There is a paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis added to incloſe the former ſentence thus,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>(For he that is hanged is accurſed of God.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This ſentence thus incloſed doth quite alter the ſenſe, and makes the exhortation to the Judges to concur with Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> ſenſe, thus, <hi>Thou ſhalt in any wiſe bury him that day, that thy land be not defiled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now according to this corrupt Tranſlation, and the onely reaſon given why the perſon hanged muſt be buried the ſame day, is, becauſe elſe the land would be defiled.</p>
                     <p>But put out the parentheſis, and put in the colon, as it was in the firſt Editions, and then the words will have a quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>I grant that the leaving out of the colon might happen through the Printers over-ſight, but the incloſing of that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in a parentheſis, could not be done by the Printers over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, but doubtleſs that was done on purpoſe by ſome left han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded perſon, as I obſerved before.</p>
                     <p>I doe therefore earneſtly intreat the judicious Presbytery
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:64895:168"/>
to make ſearch into this matter, and to cauſe a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the next Editions, according to the integrity of the firſt.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Let the Text in <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23. be read according to the firſt Editions, and then it will follow, that the onely true reaſon why he that hanged on a tree muſt be buried the ſame day, is, (not becauſe elſe the land would be defiled, but) becauſe he that is hanged—the curſe of God; ſo the Hebrew is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the margin: But there is in this ſentence a defect, or a want of ſome word, which our Tranſlaters have ſupplied in the Text by the word <hi>(is)</hi> and ſo they make the Text to run thus, <hi>He that is hanged (is) the curſe of God.</hi> But the Seventy, with <hi>Aquila,</hi> and <hi>Theodotian</hi> read it thus, <hi>He is the curſe of God</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">See <hi>Torſhel</hi> on Juſtif. p. 131.</note> 
                        <hi>that is hanged;</hi> and <hi>Symachus</hi> reads it thus, becauſe <hi>for the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy of God he is hanged;</hi> And the Chalde paraphraſe doth render it thus: for becauſe <hi>he ſinned before the Lord, hee is hanged.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe ſeveral Tranſlations and Expoſitions are conſiderable; But yet ſtill for all this, it is a queſtion of ſome moment, in what ſenſe hee that is hanged is called the curſe of God? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:64895:168"/>
of God, which elſe would certainly have been poured out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the land, in caſe this malefactor had been ſuffered to live ſtill in his ſin, and ſo juſtice being ſatisfied he muſt be buried out of ſight that day.</p>
                     <p>And hence it follows, that he was called the curſe of God <note place="margin">The true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he that was hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed muſt be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the ſame day, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his ſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to death and his hanging on a tree after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bad ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed Gods anger, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the curſe from the Land.</note> after that Gods juſtice was ſatisfied by the figure Metonymia, as the ſacrifice that was ordained to attone God for ſin, was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſin.</p>
                     <p>So then the true reaſon, why the Judges were admoniſhed not to let his carkaſs that was hanged continue hanging all night, but to bury him the ſame day, to cover and hide his carkaſs in the earth from further publick ſhame and ignominy, becauſe he had already ſatisfied Juſtice, by hanging on a tree to be gazed on, as long as the day light made him a ſpectacle, which at ſome time of the year might be till it was near mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, where the natural day endeth: So then the defect or want in the Hebrew Text may be ſupplied by any word or words that do explain the true ſenſe, as well as by <hi>(is;)</hi> As thus, thou ſhalt in any wiſe bury him the ſame day, for he that is hanged to be gazed on as long as the day gives light to be gazed on, hath appeaſed God, and born the curſe from the land, and thereby he hath made attonement for the curſe, and ſo procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Gods favor to the Land.</p>
                     <p>And it is moſt evident by three remarkable examples, that the execution of the viſible curſe upon ſuch malefactors did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure attonement to the land.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Lord himſelf commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to take the chief Ring-leaders of them that had coupled them to <hi>Baal Peor,</hi> and to hang them up before the Lord againſt the Sun, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 4. <note place="margin">Numb. 25. 4.</note>

up before the Lord, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 9. namely, by the ſentence of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, but the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> ſaid to <hi>David</hi> in v 6. <hi>We will hang them up to</hi>

                        <hi>the Lord,</hi> namely, to appeaſe his fierce anger againſt the land, and in that reſpect their hanging is ſaid in ver. 3. to make attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and to this ſenſe the Chalde paraphraſe doth render the ſenſe of <hi>Deu.</hi> 21. 23. for <hi>becauſe he ſinned before the Lord he is hanged,</hi> namely, to appeaſe his wrath.</p>
                     <p>And all that are hanged before the Lord, that is to ſay, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the ſentence of theſe Judges, are ſaid alſo to be hanged up to the Lord to appeaſe his wrath, and ſo both phraſes do demonſtrate the ſame thing, and thus to do Juſtice and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon ſinners, is more acceptable to the Lord, to attone his wrath, than ſacrifice, <hi>Pro.</hi> 21. 3.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Achan</hi> was a curſed perſon in his death (though his dead body was not hanged but burnt with fire) becauſe he had ſinned in the curſed thing, namely, in the conſecrated gold which God had curſed to any that did purloin it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ſaid unto <hi>Joſhua, I will be with you no more except yee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy that curſed perſon,</hi> Joſh. 7. 12. For <hi>Iſrael hath tranſgreſſed the Covenant which I commanded them,</hi> ver. 11. But why doth he ſay, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> tranſgreſſed, ſeeing <hi>Achan</hi> alone ſinned in a ſecret manner. The Anſwer is, Becauſe it was Gods will to make ſuch a ſupream voluntary Law and Covenant with all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that if but one man ſinned in the excommunicate thing, it ſhould involve all <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the curſe, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 6. 18. untill they had purged themſelves by the uſe of means to find out the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor, but as ſoon as they had found out the tranſgreſſor, and had executed Juſtice, and buried his burnt body under a heap of ſtones, the Lord was appeaſed to the people, and turned from his fierce wrath, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. 25, 26. and ſo the Camp was cleanſed.</p>
                     <p>Hence I do once more conclude, that the onely true reaſon why he that was hanged, muſt be buried the ſame day, was (not becauſe elſe the Land would be ceremonially defiled, as Mr. <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> doth argue, but) becauſe one days open hanging on a tree, as long as the light did laſt to be gazed on, did ſatisfie Gods Juſtice, and pacifie his wrath, and therefore the Judges are admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to let his body hang all night, but in any caſe to bury him the ſame day, becauſe he that is thus hanged hath born
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:64895:169"/>
the curſe that elſe would have fallen on the land; and the Jews ſay, That as ſoon as a Malefactor had ſatisfied juſtice by his <note place="margin">See <hi>Trap</hi> on Gal. 3. 13.</note> death, then the tree whereon he was hanged, the ſword, ſtone, or napkin, wherewith ſuch a one was executed, muſt be buried with them, that no evill memorial of them might remain, to ſay, this was the tree, ſword, ſtone, or napkin, wherewith ſuch a one was executed.</p>
                     <p>But ſtill this muſt bee remembred, that in ſome extraordinary caſes, God permitted the Magiſtrates to let ſome notorious Malefactors to hang on a Tree, not only for one day, but alſo for many dayes together, and yet the land was not defiled, but cleanſed thereby; of which ſee more in <hi>n.</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p>6 Having now finiſhed the former reaſon why the perſon hanged muſt be buried the ſame day, namely, becauſe in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe of juſtice one dayes hanging on a tree, did ſatisfie Gods juſtice, and ſo remove the curſe from the land, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in this ſentence, <hi>He that is hanged (hath born) the curſe of God:</hi> And at the end of this ſentence, the <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Tindal</hi> have made a full ſtop, and the other Tranſlations have made a colon, or a half ſtop, for the time of his burial: Then <hi>Moſes</hi> proceeds in the next ſentence to finiſh his former exhortation to the Judges (in verſe 22.) <hi>That thy land be not defiled, which the Lord thy God giveth thee to inherit;</hi> the Context, verſe 22. lies thus, <hi>If there be in thee a man,</hi> namely, <hi>any other man</hi> (beſides the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Son, in verſe 18.) <hi>that hath committed a ſin worthy of death,</hi> namely, <hi>by ſtoning, thou ſhalt ſtone him to death, and then if thou ſee cauſe, thou ſhalt hang up his dead body on a tree, that thy land bee not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed by ſuffering ſuch notorious moral ſins, and ſinners to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the only true reaſon according to the Context, why the Judges are exhorted to execute exemplary juſtice on ſuch <note place="margin">The whole land might be defiled by the Judges neglect in ſuffering notorious Malefactors to go unpuniſhed.</note> notorious moral ſinners; namely, that the land by their neglect of juſtice be not defiled, for the Judges were the whole land Repreſentatively (as I have ſhewed more at large in the Jews Synagogues Diſcipline.)</p>
                     <p>And it is evident not only by the Context, that this was the true mind and meaning of <hi>Moſes</hi> in his exhortation to the Judges, not to defile the land by pretermitting the execution of exemplary juſtice on ſuch notorious Malefactors, but alſo it
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:64895:170"/>
is further evident by comparing his exhortation here, with the like exhortations to the Judges, to cleanſe the land from moral defilements, by executing of exact juſtice againſt ſuch moral ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which elſe would defile the whole land, yea or any other land as well as the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in caſe the Magiſtrates thereof did neglect to execute impartial juſtice, and to tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate moral ſinners. See <hi>Lev. 18, 24, 25, 27, 28. Num. 35. 31, 32, 33. Pſal. 106. 38. Ezra 9. 11. Jer. 3. 1, 2, 9. Jer. 16. 18. Ezek. 36. 17. Pſal. 24. 5. &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it came to paſs, that when <hi>Phineas</hi> by his extraordinary zeal, did execute juſtice upon ſome of the moſt notorious Malefactors in <hi>Num.</hi> 25. that the plague was ſtayed, and then the land was cleanſed; for by this act of juſtice (though he was no Magiſtrate) yet being ſtirred up of God in an extraordinary way, to execute the office of a Magiſtrate, hee is ſaid to make Attonement, or to reconcile God to the whole land, <hi>Num.</hi> 25. 23. See <hi>Ainſworth</hi> alſo in <hi>Num.</hi> 35. 33, 39.</p>
                     <p>Theſe, and ſuch like inſtances, do evidence that the Judges (as they were the Repreſentatives of the whole land) might defile the whole land, and make them guilty of Gods curſe due to ſuch notorious moral ſinners, in caſe they did connive at them, and not execute impartial juſtice upon them: And this is the ſcope of <hi>Moſes</hi> exhortation to the Judges, not to defile the land; and not as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> makes the exhortation to bee, to bury the body before Sun-ſet, that the land bee not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, when the Judges were careful to execute exemplary juſtice on ſuch notorious Malefactors, they are ſaid to cleanſe the land from the objects of Gods wrath, and to make Attonement for the Land.

7 It is moſt evident that the whole Land was never defiled, by any one tranſgreſſion againſt the Ceremonial Law; I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">The whole land was never defiled by any one ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſin.</note> therefore at Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> unadviſedneſs, in making the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hanged on a tree to defile the whole Land, in caſe hee was not buried before Sun-ſet.</p>
                     <p>I grant that he, or any other might bee deceived in their judgement, by following the tranſlation of <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the corrupt Edition, as I have ſhewed before, but the right tranſlation, as it was in the firſt Editions, will not afford any ſuch Tenent, if the Context be well weighed.</p>
                     <p>2 I grant that a great part of the people might bee ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nially defiled; yea at ſometime the greateſt part, but not by any one tranſgreſſion of the Ceremonial Law, but by ſundry kinds of Ceremonial ſins, as <hi>Ainſ.</hi> ſheweth in <hi>Num.</hi> 9. 12.</p>
                     <p>3 Suppoſe it could be proved (which cannot be) that the whole land might be ceremonially defiled by ſome one perſon, or by ſome one act, then I hope it will alſo follow by a neceſſary conſequence, that God had ordained and provided ſome inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted way for the ceremonial cleanſing of the whole land, as well as for particular perſons and places; for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe God would not bee wanting in ſome inſtituted way of cleanſing for all ſorts of ceremonial defilements.</p>
                     <p>But I cannot find any ſuch inſtituted Ordinance for the cleanſing of the whole land for any one ceremonial defilement; neither can I find any one ceremonial defilement greater than that which happened by the touch of a dead perſon, for hee that touched a dead perſon, though hee dyed in his bed, yea though hee were truly godly in his life time, was as much defiled by the ceremonial Law, as he that touched the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Malefactor after he was hanged on a tree; and he that touched any dead perſon in the day time, was as much defiled by the ſentence of the Ceremonial Law, as hee that touched a dead Malefactor in the night time after Sun-ſet, and hee that touched but the limb of a dead child, was as much defiled, as he that touched a whole dead child, all that touched the dead, though never ſo many, were all alike defiled in the higheſt degree of ceremonial uncleanneſs, untill they had
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:64895:171"/>
cleamed themſelves according to the inſtituted way of cleanſing in <hi>Num.</hi> 19. 11, 15, 16 &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>It is a vain conceit to think that the whole land might be defiled ceremonially by permitting the perſon hanged, to hang on the tree after Sun-ſet, the whole land could not be defiled ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, unleſs every perſon in the land, did come one by one to touch his dead carkaſs, which is abſurd to think they would do, and yet it muſt be done, in caſe Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> do prove that the whole land was defiled by the Malefactors carkaſs unburied after Sun-ſet; And by this it appears that his knowledge in the Ceremonial Laws, is very ſhort of what it ought to be, or elſe he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have broached this fiction.</p>
                     <p>8 It is evident that the hanging of a Malefactor on a tree after Sun-ſet, did not defile the land ceremonially (ſee alſo <hi>n.</hi> 2.) for <hi>David,</hi> according to the deſire of the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> which was ordered, doubtleſs, according to Gods ſpecial poſitive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, commanded that ſeven of <hi>Sauls</hi> ſons ſhould be given to them to be hanged on a tree, and to continue hanging ſo long as until God ſhould manifeſt himſelf to be attoned and reconciled to the Land, by ſending rain to remove the preſent famine, for there was a famine in the dayes of <hi>David</hi> three years together; <hi>And</hi> David <hi>inquired of the Lord, and the Lord anſwered, It is for</hi> Saul, <hi>and for his bloody houſe, becauſe he ſlew the</hi> Gibeonites, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 1. therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> in verſe 3. <hi>What ſhall I do for you, and wherewith ſhall I make the Attonement, that ye may bleſs the inheritance of the Lord;</hi> They anſwered to the King in verſe 5. (doubtleſs by ſome ſpecial voluntary poſitive command from God) <hi>Let ſeven of his ſons be delivered to us, and we will hang them up unto the Lord,</hi> namely, to appeaſe the Lords wrath (that was ſo juſtly provoked by <hi>Sauls</hi> ſin againſt the whole land) for <hi>Saul</hi> was the Repreſentative of the whole land, and therefore he ought to have protected, and not killed the innocent <hi>Gibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onites,</hi> as he had done out of his furious zeal, by which noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious moral ſin of his, he defiled the whole land; But by the hanging of his ſeven ſons on a tree for many dayes together, the land was cleanſed from the guilt of <hi>Sauls</hi> moral ſin, and not defiled ceremonially; if it had been defiled ceremonially by their hanging on the tree after Sun-ſet, then doubtleſs it would
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:64895:171"/>
have been recorded in what manner the Land was cleanſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but no ſuch cleanſing is recorded, therefore no ſuch ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial defilement did fall upon the land by their hanging many days after ſun-ſet.</p>
                     <p>I grant that this act of Juſtice in hanging ſeven of <hi>Sauls</hi> ſons, for his ſin, was done by Gods ſpecial direction, and by his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme poſitive command, and not by the written Law of God, for no perſonal crimes were laid to the charge of theſe ſeven ſons of <hi>Saul,</hi> by the Judicial Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and therefore except ſome crime againſt the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> had been legally proved againſt them, they could not by the juſtice of <hi>Moſes</hi> revealed Laws have been put to death, much leſs could they have been hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſeven trees for their fathers ſin, whereof they might be innocent.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Goubtleſs God gave ſome ſpecial ſupreme voluntary poſitive command both to <hi>David</hi> and to the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> touching the hanging of the ſeven ſons of <hi>Saul;</hi> and after the ſame manner he gave a ſpecial poſitive command to <hi>Abraham</hi> to kill his Son for a Sacrifice, or elſe it had been an extream wickedneſs and groſs diſobedience to Gods moral Law, to kill his Son; and the like wickedneſs it would have been in <hi>David</hi> and in the <hi>Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> to hang up theſe ſeven Sons of <hi>Saul,</hi> without a ſpecial po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive command from God.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not with ſome (ſaith Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> in <hi>Chriſts dying</hi> p. 139. at Aſſer. 3.) affirm that (which in the general is true) a will contrary to Gods revealed command and will, called <hi>voluntas ſigni</hi> (which is our moral rule to oblige us) is a ſin; but a will contrary to Gods decree, called <hi>voluntas bene placiti,</hi> which is not our Rule obliging (except the Lord be pleaſed to

impoſe it on us as a moral Law) is a ſin.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Hence it follows, that the Law of burying the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hanged the ſame day, was in relation to the ordinary courſe of Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Hence it follows, that in ſome extraordinary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the ſupreme Judges had power to increaſe the length of time in hanging on a tree; At for example, <hi>David</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the hands and feet of <hi>Recbab</hi> and <hi>Banab</hi> ſhould be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up for many daies together, now by the Levitical Law every member of a dead body did defile as much as the whole body, See <hi>Ainſw.</hi> in <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. 11.

                     <p>That Act of Juſtice which doth cleanſe the Land from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall defilements, cannot be ſaid to defile the Land ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
                     <p>But the hanging of malefactors on a tree by an act of Juſtice, till after ſun-ſet, doth cleanſe the land.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, that act of Juſtice in letting ſuch malefact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors hang till after ſun-ſet, doth not defile the Land ceremonially.</p>

Some of theſe unſound notions I find in <hi>Weams</hi> third Volume on <hi>Dan.</hi> 21. and alſo in his four Degenerations, 327. where he pleads, to little purpoſe, for the typical ſenſe as Mr. <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> doth: But from all Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> imaginary notions heaped up together, what is the inference, but this? That the curſe in <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23. did typifie that Chriſt was to redeem us from the curſe of the Law, by bearing the moral curſe in our ſtead on the croſs.</p>
                     <p>But I have ſufficiently ſhewed already that this inference is builded but upon falſe premiſes, and therefore all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments uſed to prove it do vaniſh to nothing.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, But if his inference had been no more but this, That therefore the Law in <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23. was peculiar to the Commonwealth of the Jews (and not common to other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) it might have been granted to him. And the like may be ſaid of divers other political Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that they were in force onely in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and that neither before <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> time, nor after Chriſts death, they were in force, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I grant alſo that there were many Judicial Laws that were partly civil and partly ceremonial, and ſo it may be granted that the Law in <hi>Deu.</hi> 21. 23. had ſome ceremonial conſiderations about the burial of the dead body, for it defiled all that touched it. But yet it will not thence follow, that it defiled the whole land, in caſe it
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:64895:173"/>
continued unburied till after ſun-ſet, and therefore it did not typifie that Chriſt ſhould bear the moral and eternal curſe on the tree for our redemption, which is the very point that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> hath undertaken to make good from <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23.

It is not ſo generally received as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> would perſwade his Reader, it is well enough known that there were and are many godly and judicious ones, that dare not hold that Chriſt ſuffered the moral and eternal curſe for our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I doe not finde that <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> held that Chriſt ſuffered Hell torments, or the ſecond death.</p>
                     <p>It is objected, ſaith <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> that Chriſt for our ſake <note place="margin">In Rom. 9. 1, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>,</p>
                     <p>The ſecond doubt (faith he) is concerning Chriſt; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he for our ſakes ſuffered death, yet was he not in very deed ſeparated from God but his humanity was holpen when he ſuffered on the croſs all extream pains; he was alſo made a curſe as touching the puniſhment of the Law, which puniſhment he ſuffered for our ſalvation ſake, and he was counted as a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> and being as it were convicted of theſe crimes, he was condemned. But yet was he not by eternal damnation ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from God.</p>
                     <p>In this Anſwer <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> hath left his judgement upon record how Chriſt was forſaken on the croſs, and how he was made a curſe by hanging on the tree; he was made a curſe, ſaith he, as touching the puniſhment of the Law, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23. and, ſaith he, he was counted as a Blaſphemer, and an ungodly
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:64895:173"/>
perſon; and being, as it were, convicted of theſe crimes, he was condemned, but yet was he not by eternal damnation, (namely, by ſuffering that, which to the creature is eternal damnation) ſeparated from God.</p>
                     <p>By this anſwer it is evident, That he held that Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered no other curſe but the outward curſe of hanging on a tree, juſt as <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Theephilact</hi> ſpake, as I have cited them in the former Chap. in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21.</p>

                     <p>Sixthly, I find that others do cite <hi>Bullenger</hi> and <hi>Zanchy</hi> as not cleaving to Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> Tenent of Hell Torments. But I have not throughly ſearched them, but in a great part I have, and can find no ſuch thing in them; Let them that pleaſe ſearch them fully.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> and his followers, which to this day are many, that are both pious and learned; and they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Tenent of Hell Torments on the croſs, as no Article of their faith.</p>
                     <p>I will cite onely two paſſages out of Mr. <hi>Broughton,</hi> beſides what I have cited in the Dialogue.</p>

4 Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> ſaith, That the ancient godly Hebrew Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors that lived after <hi>Ezra,</hi> ſeeing the increaſe of Sadduces, <note place="margin">In his Reduct. on Dan 9.</note> they did frame divers terms to expreſs the world to come, both in relation to the godly, and to the wicked Epicurean Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and thoſe terms in their ſenſe doth the New Teſtament ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and follow; and they made the term, Second-death, to expreſs the immortal miſery that belongs to the ſoul of the wicked in the world to come, they made the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual death of the ſoul by original ſin, and the death of the body, to be the death of this world: And <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks juſt as the Dialogue doth (as I have cited him in Chap. 16. Reply 20.) <note place="margin">All ſorts of death that men do ſuffer in this world, is counted but the firſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death in the world to come.</note> That the ſpiritual death of ſin, and the death of the body is the Firſt-death, becauſe it belongs to all men in this world; and ſo doth <hi>Zanchy</hi> in his Sermons, page 162. and that the Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>death belongs only to the wicked after this life is ended. But Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> oppoſeth this diviſion of death in page 115. and page 120. and makes a threefold death to confound the Reader about the term Second-death in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. and ſo hee evades his anſwer, to the main ſcope of the Dialogues Argument (againſt Chriſts ſuffering of the Second-death) which is this, namely, That the Second-death cannot be ſuffered in this life, where the Firſt-death only is ſuffered by Gods appointment. But on the contrary, he labours to maintain that Chriſt ſuffered the Second-death in this world, by Gods extraordinary diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But I have formerly anſwered that the Papiſts may in like fort maintain the Miracles that they aſcribe to their legion of Saints, if they may but flye to Gods extraordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation.</p>
                     <p>8 Mr. <hi>Anthony Wotton</hi> denied Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> Tenent, though for ſome reſpects beſt known to himſelf, he was ſparing to publiſh <note place="margin">

                     <p>9 I find by conference with ſuch as have been wel read in the Ancient Divines, that nothing in them without wreſting their ſenſe, can be found that doth evidence, that they held that God

                     <head>But yet Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> makes a great ſhew for his expoſition, by citing <hi>Junius, Piſcator, Parker,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ainſworth;</hi> as concurring with his ſenſe, therefore I will make a ſhort Reply.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply</hi> 11. The two firſt (I perceive by conference with ſuch as have peruſed them) ſpeak very moderately and ſparingly, and not ſo full as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth; but ſuppoſe they were fully of his mind, yet that could not prove no more but this, That Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> is not alone in his expoſition and collections, and ſo much may the Dialogue ſay; but all that are judicious do know, that it is not mans conſent, but Scripture rightly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, and Arguments drawn from a right interpretation that muſt determine the point.</p>
                     <p>3 I have not yet examined what Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> ſaith.</p>
                     <p>4 As for Mr. <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> he is a little too bold to make him full of his judgement; let his mind and meaning be examined by conferring with his own words in his Annotations in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. in <hi>Num.</hi> 21. 9. in <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 32. in <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 21. in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 4. Beſides, I received ſome letters from him in his life-time about this controverſie, whereby I know that his judgement was not throughly eſtabliſhed one way or other; and I know by ſome expreſſions of his, that he could not hold that Chriſt ſuffered
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:64895:176"/>
Hell-torments, though he did hold that Chriſt ſuffered the wrath of God in ſome degree; and I find that other learned Divines do hold as he did, namely, That Chriſt ſuffered the wrath of God in ſome degree, and yet they deny that he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hell-torments, and the Second-death, which is alſo directly contrary to Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> fundamentals; for hee holds juſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction by a juſt ſuffering of the eſſential Curſe of Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torments.</p>

Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> but alſo may gather up all the Curſes of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law together, and expound the ſame of Chriſt; for as Chriſt is innocent in this general Law touching his perſon, ſo it healſo in all the reſt; and as he is guilty in this general Law, in that he is made a curſe for us, and hanged upon the Croſs as a wicked man, a blaſphemer, a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, and a traitor, even ſo is he guilty alſo in all others; for all the Curſes of the Law, are heaped together, and laid upon him.</p>
                     <p>Hence it follows from <hi>Luthers</hi> words, approved by Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> that the ſaid Curſes mentioned by Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> were laid upon Chriſt; or elſe Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> muſt not approve of this ſpeech of <hi>Luther.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Rutherfurd</hi> propounds this Queſtion; How could Chriſt <note place="margin">In Chriſts dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. p. 560, 561.</note> be a Curſe? There is (ſaith he) a thing intrinſecally and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:64895:176"/>
fundamentally curſed, and there is a thing extrinſecally and effectively curſed: Now (ſaith he) none but he that ſinneth, is intrinſecally and fundamentally curſed; for in this regard, it is a perſonal evil, Chriſt was not intrinſecally abominable, and execrable to God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This diſtinction of extrinſecally and effectively curſed, was contrived only for the ſake of Chriſt, or elſe doubtleſs, hee would have given ſome other inſtance of his aſſertion.</p>
                     <p>I grant, That Mr. <hi>Rutherfurd</hi> did hold that Chriſt did ſuffer the moral Curſe, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>h; But yet he held it arbytrary to the Lawgiver to execute the curſe on Chriſt, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the equivalency than in the proper kind of it; and therefore he ſaith, That ſome puniſhments may well bee changed, the one for the other, as Gods hating and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſinner, was changed into Gods forſaking of Chriſt, when he complained, <hi>My God, my God, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſecondly, ſaith he, Chriſt was not intrinſecally curſed as the ſinner who ſinneth in perſon is; and then he concludes, that the kind of puniſhment which Chriſt ſuffered, was arby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Lawgiver.</p>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> denies it to be arbytrary, for ſaith he, in page 10. The Omnipotent had ſo limited himſelf by his Law <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Nerton</hi> holds ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by Chriſts ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial curſe in kind, and yet he holds alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency.</note> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. that he could not alter; and ſaith hee in page 146. 143. though in many typical redemptions, God accepted a price, and ſpared life, yet not ſo in the Antitype; No price (ſaith he) can diſpence in the caſe of the Antitype: And ſaith he, in page 122. Chriſt was tormented without any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, God ſpared him nothing of the due debt, he had not the leaſt drop of water to eaſe him of the leaſt particle of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that was due according to juſtice: And ſaith he, in page 23. he ſuffered the whole, eſſential, properly penal death of the Curſe, that is, the whole eſſential puniſhment thereof, was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>By theſe fundamental Propoſitions, he muſt reject any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the way of equivalency; and yet he is ſometimes forced to flye to equivalency, as I have noted it in Chap. 4.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs, I cannot but wonder that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth keep no more exactly to his principles of payment in kind, but that he is forced to flye ſometimes to equivalency.</p>

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 5. This I beleeve is a falſe charge; I do not remember <note place="margin">Chriſts death was not a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural death.</note> that the Dialogue doth any where call the death of Chriſt a natural death; but it doth carefully ſhun that term, as altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unfit, becauſe the death of Chriſt was ſupernatural. The Dialogue holds that Chriſt was not ſubject to a natural death, as ſinners are from the curſe of original ſin in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19, as I have ſhewed a little before, and ſhall do it again towards the end of this Chapter.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, But yet the Dialogue doth often call the death of Chriſt a true bodily death (in oppoſition to Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual death) with this explanation; that his death was ſuch a kind of bodily death, that it was alſo a mediatorial death and ſacrifice.</p>

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 6. I ſhall ſpeak the briefer to this inference, becauſe I have already ſhewed in <hi>Reply</hi> 3. That the humane nature of Chriſt was priviledged from death, and from the fear of death, and from all other miſeries by nature; But yet ſuch was his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and eternal love to the Elect that were fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> that according to the Council of the Trinity, he entred into a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:64895:179"/>
with his Father, to take upon him the ſeed of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived woman, with our infirmities, and to enter the Liſts, and to combate with Satan that had a Commiſſion given him to peirce him in the foot-ſoals, with an ignominious death, and therefore he covenanted to manifeſt the truth of his humane nature, in fearing and abhorring ſuch a kind of uſage for the ſalvation ſake of all the Elect: And ſaith <hi>Rutherfurd</hi> on the Covenant, page 342. God by a permiſſive decree, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the crucifying of the Lord of life, but as touching his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and commanding will, he did neither will the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of his Son, but forbids, and hates it as execrable mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Then conſider Chriſts troubled natural fear of death ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially, with all the circumſtances of ignominy and tortures from the Devil and his Inſtruments, according to Gods decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red permiſſion in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and then it was his duty to ſtir up his ſenſitive ſoul to be tenderly, and eminently touched with a trembling fear, and with a manifeſt abhorring of this kind of uſage.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 But conſider his ignominious and painful death formally, namely, with the reward that was annexed to it by Gods Covenant, which was that he ſhould thereby merit the ſalvation of all the Elect; and then I ſay, It was the duty of his rational ſoul not to fear, but earneſtly to deſire to perform this combate with Satan, and to ſuffer him to do his worſt; and therefore in this regard, he ſaid, I <hi>delight to do thy will, O God, thy Law is in my heart,</hi> Heb. 10. And I deſire to eat this Paſsover, this Type of my death, before I ſuffer.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Chriſts humane nature knew perfectly by the revealed will of God, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. that God had armed the Devil againſt him, with an expreſs permiſſion to uſe him as a ſinful Malefactor, and to peirce him in the foot-ſoals, and in this combate, hee knew it was the declared will of God, that hee ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter him (not with the power of his God-head, but) with his humane nature only, as it was accompanied with our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, of fear, ſorrow, &amp;c. and therefore by his Covenant hee was bound to expreſs and manifeſt his troubled natural fear of ſuch an unnatural uſage, and accordingly he declared it to his three Apoſtles that he took with him to be witneſſes, that he did
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:64895:180"/>
then begin to be ſorrowful, and very heavy, ſaying unto them, <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful, even to the death,</hi> Mat. 26, 37, 38, 39. <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 38, 39.</note> and then he went a little further from them, and fel on his face, and prayed, ſaying, <hi>O my Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me;</hi> and this requeſt he made three times over, becauſe it was of abſolute neceſſity that that cup ſhould paſs from him, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the cup of his natural fear.</p>
                     <p>I have ſhewed in the Dialogue, page 46. that the word Cup, is put for a meaſure, or portion of any thing, either of joy and comfort, or of ignominy and pain, or of fear and ſorrow, and at this time he was very heavy and ſorrowful; and therefore the cup that he doth ſo earneſtly deprecate, is the cup, or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or portion of his preſent natural fear.</p>
                     <p>Hee doth not in this place (as I apprehend) deprecate his ignominious and painful death, but the fear and dread which his ſenſitive ſoul had of it at this preſent, and he was heard and delivered from his natural fear, or elſe hee could not have laid down his life by his own will, deſire and power, as hee had covenanted, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 17, 18. But as ſoon as hee had obtained a confirmation by his ſweating prayers againſt this his natural fear, then when the band was come to apprehend him, he was fearleſs, and ſaid unto <hi>Peter, Put up thy ſword again into its place, for all they that take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword; thinkeſt thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he ſhall preſently give me more</hi>

portion of my ignominious and painful ſufferings which my Father hath appointed mee to undergo, as hee hath declared it in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. Here you ſee that Chriſt did not now dread this cup of his ignominious and painful ſufferings, as hee did the fear of this cup in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26 37. Then it was neceſſary before he prayed, that his natural infirmities of fear and ſorrow ſhould appear, but now it was as neceſſary after he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his requeſt, that his natural infirmities ſhould not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; and therefore he ſaid to <hi>Peter, Shall I not drink it?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4 I have ſhewed from Mr. <hi>Rutherfurd</hi> in Chap. 2. that Chriſts deſire that the cup might paſs from him, was no ſin, becauſe the command of God to lay down his life was not a moral command (as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> unadviſedly doth affirm) for if his death had been required by a moral command, then his deſire that the cup might paſs from him, had been a ſin (and then his natural fear of death had been a ſin alſo) but Gods command was a meer poſitive command, and that kind of command, ſaith Mr. <hi>Rutherfurd,</hi> did never root out his natural deſire to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his own life, ſeeing hee ſubmitted his deſire to Gods will; The like inſtance hee gives of <hi>Abrahams</hi> deſire, when God commanded him to kill his only Son for a ſacrifice: And though Mr. <hi>Rutherfurd</hi> holds that Chriſt ſuffered Hell-torments, <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 7.</note> yet he denies (as the Dialogue doth) that the word Fear in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7. is to be underſtood of his fear of Hell-torments; hee expounds it (as the Dialogue doth) on the Covenant, page 362.</p>
                     <p>But ſtill I rather think (as I ſaid before) that Chriſt did not deſire ſimply at any time to be freed from death, for that had been to deſire to be freed from the performance of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; but only from the cup of his natural fear, &amp; from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent natural diſtruſt of his ignominious uſage by his ignominious and painful death; and in this prayer and ſupplication of his, he was heard and delivered, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7. and this requeſt was of neceſſity to be obtained, or elſe he could not have fulfilled his Covenant, which was, that he would lay down his life by his own free will deſire, and power, even by the active power, and joynt concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of both his natures, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 17. 18. and this command he could not fulfil until he had obtained a confirmation by his earneſt prayers in the Garden, againſt his natural fear of death:
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:64895:181"/>
And hence it follows, that ſeeing Chriſt could not prevent his decreed death, he was bound by his Covenant to be troubled (at leaſt for a time) with the fear of it, and that in a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent manner, as much as his humane, tender, natural conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could bear without fin, namely, until he had by his earneſt prayers obtained a confirmation.</p>

All the godly do affirm that in death there is a feeling of the wrath of God, and therefore of its own nature it driveth men into a certain pain and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, which thing (ſaith he) both Chriſt himſelf when he prayed in the Garden, and many other holy men have declared: And (ſaith he) if there chance to be any to whom it is pleaſant and delectable to dye, and to be rid of their life, that they have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and not from the nature of death.</p>
                     <p>In theſe words obſerve that <hi>P.

If Chriſt had ſhewed no more natural fear of death than ſome men do, it might well have been doubted whether hee had been true man or no, ſeeing ſundry Hereticks have called it into queſtion, notwithſtanding hee gave ſuch large teſtimony of it by his exceeding natural fear as hee did.</p>
                     <p>I find this excellent Obſervation in our larger Annotations on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 1. We further briefly ſay, That Chriſt was pleaſed to yeeld to ſenſe (or feeling) ſo far,</p>
                     <p>1 That he might ſhew himſelf a perfect true man; a thing not eaſily beleeved, as appears by the multitude of Hereſies about this matter, that ſprung up ſoon after the firſt plantation of the faith, there being no greater evidence to ordinary judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at leaſt, of his perfect humanity, than his being ſubject to the common infirmities of men.</p>

                     <p>Fourthly, this is obſervable, That though many Martyrs have, through the grace of conſtancy, undergone the pains of death with joy, or with little ſign of their natural fear of death, <note place="margin">When the pains of death have aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſanctified reaſon in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, then no man can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs what conflict there is between na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and death which conflict was not in Chriſt.</note> whiles they have had the uſe of their ſanctified reaſon, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards as ſoon as their torments have aſtoniſhed nature, and by that means deprived them of the uſe of their ſanctified rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then the ſame ſoul that was ſo fearleſs at firſt, doth begin to ſhew the terrors of nature at the dominion of death, and then no man can expreſs what conflicts of fear and horror there is in nature againſt death; but the manner of Chriſts death was far otherwiſe, for at the utmoſt point of death, Chriſts humane nature did not conflict with fear and horror, as all Martyrs do: But hee expreſſed his natural fear and horror of death beforehand in the Garden as it were in private to three
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:64895:182"/>
of his Diſciples, that they might record it as a proof of his true humane nature; for he did manifeſt it,</p>

                     <p>And ſecondly, in the time of his prayers: but not after his prayers, there was no mention of any more fear: for by his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers he had obtained a confirmation of his nature againſt the fear of his ignominious uſage, and againſt the fear of death; I ſay it once more, that it may be the better marked, that after his prayers, hee never ſhewed any fear of death more; yea when he was at the very point of death upon the Croſs, hee did not expreſs any natural ſtrugling or ſtriving with the pangs of death, for there was no pangs in his death, becauſe the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of it was ſupernatural, and therefore his nature was not now ſubject to ſtrive with the pangs of death, as nature doth in all Martyrs; the formality of his death did far ſurpaſs the death of all Martyrs, becauſe he had obtained a deliverance, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation from his natural fear of death, by his ſtrong crying, prayers, and tears in the Garden, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7. So that when hee came to breath out his ſoul in the open view of all men, both of his perſecutors, and of his godly friends, he did without <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 7.</note> any trembling or ſtrugling of nature, inſtantly, and quietly, breath out his ſoul by his own Prieſtly power, even whiles hee was in ſtrength of nature, and this I hope is contrary to the courſe of nature in the death of all Martyrs; And by this laſt act of Chriſt in his death, he declared himſelf to be our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator in his death, and to be our High-prieſt in his death and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
                     <p>Lord (ſaith <hi>Cyprian)</hi> thou didſt profeſs thy ſelf before thine <note place="margin">Cyprian de Paſt Chriſti.</note> Apoſtles to be ſorrowful unto death, and for exceeding grief, didſt powre forth a bloody ſweat: But (ſaith hee) I admire thee, O Lord, that being once faſtened to the Croſs, amidſt the condemned, to be now, neither ſorrowful, nor fearful, but deſpiſing the puniſhments, with thy hands lifted up, to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over <hi>Amaleck.</hi> Here you ſee that <hi>Cyprians</hi> judgement was, That Chriſt was neither ſorrowful nor fearful for his death, when he hung upon the Croſs, as hee was in the Garden, and therefore hee held that Chriſt had overcome this fear and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of death by his prayers in the Garden.</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly, That in the Garden, hee did powre
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:64895:183"/>
forth a bloody ſweat, for fear of his bodily death.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Hee held that Chriſt triumphed over <hi>Amaleck,</hi> that is to ſay, over Satan, by his unconquerable patience on the Croſs.</p>

                     <p>Hence it follows, that the two reaſons of the Dialogue afore cited, ſtand ſtronger and firmer than they did, notwithſtanding Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> hath endeavoured to ſhake them to nothing by his windy reaſoning.</p>
                     <p>But in Page 58. Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth vindicate <hi>Calvin</hi> from the Dialogue ſenſe to his ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply</hi> 9. What the Dialogue cited out of Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſts troubled fear of death, where his words run with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mention of Hell-torments, was at the firſt uſeful to me, and I thought that the ſame ſpeeches might bee of the like good uſe to others, eſpecially ſeeing the Dialogue doth annex unto the former ſpeeches of <hi>Calvin,</hi> his expreſſions of Chriſts troubled ſoul-ſorrows for the death of <hi>Lazarus</hi> by his weeping and groaning in ſpirit, and troubling himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 33, 35. In which ſoul-troubles ſo pathetically manifeſted, no man can imagine that he ſuffered any thing in ſoul from Gods immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate wrath, or from Hell-torments; and therefore why ſhould we not likewiſe expound his other ſoul-ſorrows to be in relation to his ignominious and painful death?</p>
                     <p>But ſeeing Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> is not willing to accept his words, as I cited them, to the ſenſe of the Dialogue, let him take Mr. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> on his ſide; the truth of the Dialogue I hope, may ſtand well enough without him, and in caſe hee ſhall except againſt any other that I have cited for illuſtration, I ſhall not much paſs, as long as I cite the Scripture ſenſe according to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text.</p>
                     <p>But for all this, it ſeems that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> is not very well pleaſed with Mr. <hi>Calvins</hi> judgement; for in page 61. Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth cite him on purpoſe to confute him.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THe words in the Dialogue run thus in page 46. our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour doth explain the quality of thoſe ſorrows which hee ſuffered at the time of his death, unto the two ſons of <hi>Zebedeus,</hi> he tells them, <hi>They muſt drink of his cup, and be baptized with his baptiſm,</hi> Mar. 10. 39. Hee tells them, That they muſt bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the quality and kind of his ſufferings, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there might bee ſome difference in the degree of their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and he doth explain the kind of his ſufferings by a twofold expreſſion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Hee tells them, <hi>They muſt drink of his cup,</hi> that is to ſay, of the ſame bitter portion of death.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Hee tells them, <hi>That they muſt be baptized with his baptiſm,</hi>
                     <pb n="306" facs="tcp:64895:184"/>
that is to ſay, They muſt be put to death by the malice of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, as he muſt be; and this is expreſſed by the metaphor of Baptiſm, for baptizing is a diving or drowning of the whole body under water; and therefore Chriſt ordained Baptiſm as a typical ſign of drowning the body of ſin in his blood; but the baptizing of Tyrants was uſed for no other end, but to drown mens bodies to death; and in this reſpect Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am entred into the deep waters,</hi> Pſal. 69. 2, 15. and in this very ſenſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Elſe what ſhall they do that are baptized for dead</hi> (namely, what ſhall they do that are baptized with death, as Martyrs are) <hi>if the dead riſe not at all, why then are they baptized for dead? 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 29.

                  <p>By theſe two expreſſions (ſaith the Dialogue) which are <hi>Synonima</hi> or equivalent, our Saviour doth inform the two ſons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> what the true nature of his ſufferings ſhould bee, namely, no other, but ſuch only, as they ſhould one day ſuffer from the hands of Tyrants. And hence it follows,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That the troubled fear, which <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> do aſcribe unto Chriſt in the Garden, muſt bee underſtood of his natural fear of death, and not of his fear of his Fathers wrath.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Hence it follows, that all the (outward) ſufferings of Chriſt, were from mans wrath and malice incited by the Devil, according to Gods decree declared in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. Thou Sathan ſhalt peirce him in the foot-ſoals.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, I have often ſhewed from the firſt declared Will and Covenant of the Trinity, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. that Chriſt covenanted to take upon him our nature of the ſeed of the deceived wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and in that nature to break the Devils Head-plot by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing obedient in his combate, notwithſtanding Satan: foul play to provoke him to ſome impatience, and in that obedience, he covenanted to make his ſoul a ſacrifice, which God covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to reward with the redemption of all the Elect; and this was ſully declared unto <hi>Adam</hi> by a typical ſacrifice; and God gave the Devil full liberty to do his worſt to diſturb his patience, and ſo to ſpoyl his obedience, and ſo to prevent his death from being a ſacrifice, and ſo to preſerve his Head-plot from being broken; and this is comprehended in that ſentence, Thou Satan ſhalt peirce him in the foot-ſoals; but God could not have declared all this, both to the Devil, and unto <hi>Adam,</hi> unleſs the ſecond perſon had beforehand covenanted to undertake this conflict with the Devil, and his inſtruments, and unleſs God the Father had alſo covenanted, that the obedience of the ſeed of the woman, both in his conflict with Satan, and in his death and ſacrifice, ſhould break the Devils Head-plot, and ſo ſhould thereby merit the ſalvation of all the Elect.</p>
                     <p>But thirdly, Obſerve this, that I do not ſay that the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt, which hee indured from the malice of Satan,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:64895:185"/>
and his inſtruments, were full ſatisfaction without his ſacrifice in the formality of his death; but on the contrary, I ſay, that no ſufferings, though never ſo great, can make ſatisfaction without his ſacrifice in the formality of his death, by the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his ſoul from his body by his own Prieſtly power; and therefore if it could be ſuppoſed that Chriſt had born the moral curſe of Hell-torments (according to Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent) for a thouſand yeers together on the Croſs, yet without this his laſt Prieſtly act of death and ſacrifice, it could not have been a ſufficient price for our redemption; and the reaſon thereof is moſt cleer and evident, becauſe God had ordained by his eternal Councel and Covenant, declared in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. that nothing ſhould be accepted for full ſatisfaction to break the Devils Head-plot, without the true bodily death of the ſeed of the woman, made a ſacrifice in the formality of it by his own Prieſtly power; he muſt be the only Prieſt in the formality of his own death and ſacrifice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 27. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14, 25, 26, 28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10 9, 10, 12.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Yet I grant, notwithſtanding that all his ſufferings from Satan, and his inſtruments, were ordained for the trial of <note place="margin">All Chriſts ſufferings were as neceſſary to his ſacrifice as the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prieſt was to his ſacrifice.</note> his obedience, and ſo for his conſecration to his Prieſtly Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and in that reſpect it was as neceſſary to his ſacrifice, as the conſecration of the Prieſt was to the making of a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice under the Law, I ſay, that both his conſecration by his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious uſage, and by his long lingring tortures on the Croſs, and the formality of his death and ſacrifice by his own Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power, muſt be conſidered as two diſtinct Articles of the eternal Covenant, though they muſt alſo be conjoyned for the making of that ſacrifice, that God covenanted to accept for <note place="margin">Heb 2. 10.

finiſhed, Job.</hi> 19. 30. And then at the ſame inſtant, without any delay, he firſt bowed his head, and then he made his life a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice by giving up the ghoſt; and this was in a differing order from that death that comes by the courſe of nature, for by the courſe of nature men do hold up the head as long as life is in the body, and then as ſoon as the ſoul is departed, the head falls; but Chriſt, while he was in the ſtrength of nature, did firſt bow his head, and then hee gave up the ghoſt: And thus he performed his death as the Mediator of the New Covenant by his own Prieſtly power in both his natures, according to the eternal Covenant.</p>

And therefore from hence it neceſſarily follows, that till this laſt act was done, no ſufferings that went before (though he be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> to have ſuffered the eſſential torments of Hell) though never ſo long, and never ſo ſtrong, could bee accounted of God for ſatisfaction for mans Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Fifthly, All this was made manifeſt to fallen <hi>Adam,</hi> by Gods declared decree, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. as I have formerly noted, and I think it needful to repeat it again with ſome inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 God proclaimed an utter enmity between Chriſt the ſeed of the Woman, and the Devil in the Serpent, and in all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of his malice.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Hee told the Devil (that hee might arm himſelf as well as hee could) that the ſeed of that deceived Woman ſhould break his Head-plot, by continuing obedient to all the poſitive Laws of the combate, notwithſtanding his foul play, and his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious ſtratagems to diſturb him in the courſe of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Hee told the Devil, that hee ſhould have full liberty to uſe him as a vilde Malefactor, and at laſt to peirce him in the foot-ſoals on the Croſs to diſturb his patience, and ſo to ſpoyl his obedience, and ſo to hinder his death from being a
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:64895:186"/>
ſacrifice of ſatisfaction, if he could.</p>
                     <p>In this manner, I ſay, God declared the plotform of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal counſel and Covenant of the Trinity for mans redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore whatſoever is ſpoken after this of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, and of the work of Redemption, it muſt have reference to this firſt declaration; for all that is ſpoken after this is but a comment upon this, and all Chriſts ſufferings are included in theſe two words, 1. He ſhall be the ſeed of the woman, and he ſhall be touched both inwardly with the feeling of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities in all his voluntary paſſions.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Outwardly, Thou Satan ſhalt peirce him in the foot-ſoals; And hence it is plain, that all his outward ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were to be from Satan and his inſtruments, and all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſufferings from himſelf. Theſe things are ſo plain in the Text, that he that runs may read them; and theſe ſoul-paſſions with his outward ſufferings were alſo ordained to conſecrate Chriſt to his Prieſtly Office, before he could make his ſoul a ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Therefore the formality of Chriſts obedience in his death and ſacrifice, muſt needs be the period of all ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and this is the laſt victorious act of the Mediators obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that gives the fatal blow to the Devils head-plot, and breaks it all to peeces, ſo that the Elect are thereby deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from his power, as a bird from the Fowler, when the ſnare is broken; and all the poſitive ceremonial Laws touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prieſt and ſacrifice are but a typical exemplification of this Prieſt and ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Hence we may learn how to interpret all thoſe <note place="margin">God did all the external ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and Chriſt did all his internal ſoul-ſufferings.</note> Scriptures that aſcribe all Chriſts ſufferings both inward and outward to God; God is often ſaid to be a doer of them all; but this firſt Declaration of Gods counſel to <hi>Adam</hi> tells us that God did all by appointing Satan to do all the external ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and that God did appoint Chriſt (as he was the ſeed of the woman) to do all his internal ſufferings; and thus God may be ſaid to do all his ſoul-ſufferings, becauſe he was firſt in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that Covenant, where it was agreed on what Chriſt ſhould ſuffer for mans redemption; He firſt expounded to the ſecond perſon, that he ſhould take mans nature of the ſeed of the woman, and mans infirmities, affections, and paſſions, that ſo
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:64895:187"/>
he might be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, as our merciful High-Prieſt, when the objects of fear, ſorrow, and heavineſs ſhould preſent. In this ſenſe God may be ſaid to do all his ſoul-ſufferings.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, God is ſaid to do all, becauſe he delivered him into the hands of Satan, that Satan might do his worſt in his combate with him, <hi>Him being delivered</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter) by the determinate coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and ſort-knowledge of God,</hi> Act. 2. 23, 24. (who delivered him but <note place="margin">Act. 2. 23, 24.</note> God? &amp; to whom did he deliver him, but to Satan to combate with him? according to Gods declared will, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.) <hi>ye have taken him, and by wicked hands have crucified and ſlain, whom God hath raiſed up, looſing the pains of death;</hi> namely, looſing or healing the ſoars and wounds that were inflicted on his body by Satan and his inſtruments to put him to death; But no ſoars were inflicted on him by Gods immediate wrath, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoars were put upon him, but ſuch as God permitted the Devil and his inſtruments to inflict, out of a deſign to provoke his patience (as he did to <hi>Job)</hi> that ſo he might pervert him in his obedience, and ſpoil his death from being a ſacrifice, and ſo might prevent the breaking of his firſt head-plot, which was to ſubdue <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſterity under the body of ſin.</p>
                     <p>So in <hi>Rom. 4. 25. He was delivered for our offences;</hi> namely, God delivered him into the hands of Satan, according to <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 25.</note> to try maſteries with Satan, and in caſe Satan could diſturb his patience, then he ſhould ſave his head-plot, but in caſe Chriſt did continue through all the combate, obedient to the poſitive Laws of the combate, to the death of the Croſs, and at laſt in that perfect obedience make his ſoul a ſacrifice, then he ſhould redeem us from all our offences; And in this ſenſe it was that Chriſt was delivered for our offences, and God raiſed him up again on the third day to witneſs our Juſtification, that his death was accepted of God as a Sacrifice for full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And in this ſenſe it is ſaid, that <hi>God ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all.</hi> Rom. 8. 32.</p>
                     <p>And thus I have ſhewed how Chriſt drunk the cup of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom for his Prieſtly conſceration to his ſacrifice. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That the cup of ſatisfaction (by vertue of the free Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant) lies both in his Combate and Sacrifice; but chiefly in
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:64895:187"/>
Sacrifice, as the finiſhing act, and formal price of all ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 13. To deny that Chriſts ſoul ſuffered by way of ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, I ſuppoſe is to deny a truth: for the immortal ſoul is <note place="margin">There is a ſympathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſoul and body in ſufferings.</note> united perſonally to the body by the ſenſitive ſoul, and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this conjunction there is a communion, by which means the ſoul may partake of the ſufferings of the body, by way of ſympathy.</p>
                     <p>There are three things, ſaith <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> of which the intire <note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> Annot. in 1 Theſ. 5. 23.</note> perfect man conſiſteth, Fleſh, Soul, and Spirit; The Soul, ſaith he, is betwixt the Fleſh and Spirit, and ſometimes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit, is elevated by it; and ſometimes conſenting to the Fleſh, falls into earthly concupiſcences.</p>
                     <p>And ſaith <hi>Jerom,</hi> The Soul conſiſting between the Fleſh and <note place="margin">And <hi>Jerom.</hi> in Gal. 5.</note> Spirit, when it yeeldeth to the Fleſh it is called fleſh. By this it appears there is a communion by ſympathy.</p>
                     <p>But now becauſe Chriſts humane nature was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt after the image of God, we muſt ſay that his rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Will did cauſe his ſenſitive Will to follow it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by his ſtrong crying, and prayers, and tears, in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, he obtained that his ſenſitive will which naturally abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and feared death, was at laſt made like unto his rational will, altogether fearleſs of death, and therefore as ſoon as he had done praying, he ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Let us go meet them,</hi> and then without any fear he went to meet all his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſo by the perfection of his patience under them, he did evidence the perfection of his obedience, and in that perfection of obedience he finiſhed all that was written of him, and then he made his death a ſacrifice by the joynt
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:64895:188"/>
concurrence of both his natures; and ſo at laſt without the leaſt fear or ſtriving in his ſenſitive will, he breathed out his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul. But Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> confounds Chriſts ſacrifice with his ſufferings, and hee confounds his ſufferings from Satan, with his ſufferings from Gods immediate wrath, in pag. 153. 213, &amp;c.</p>

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 14. Firſt, I have ſhewed in Chap. 12. at Sect. 4. that <note place="margin">The ſufferings of Chriſts ſoul in Mat. 26. 38. and Iſa. 53. 10. muſt chiefly be underſtood Chriſts vital ſoul, and nor of his immortal ſoul. Matth. 26. 38. Iſa. 53. 10.</note> Chriſts ſoul did not ſuffer any thing at all from Gods imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate wrath.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I have ſhewed, that the word Soul in theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is not in the firſt place meant of Chriſts immortal ſoul, but of his vital ſoul; for <hi>Nepheſh</hi> in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10, and <hi>Pſyche</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 38. (for it is not as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> cites it in v. 37.) is not meant of Chriſts immortal ſoul, but of his ſenſitive ſoul; as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed in chap. 7.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nepheſh,</hi> ſaith <hi>Carlile,</hi> is never uſed in the Old Teſtament for the immortal ſpirit, and <hi>Pſyche</hi> is very ſeldom uſed in the New Teſtament for the immortal ſpirit, but (ſaith he) it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly uſed for the ſenſitive ſoul; <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to <hi>Epaphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> that <hi>for the work of Chriſt he was nigh unto death, not regarding his Soul,</hi> Phil. 2. 30.</p>
                     <p>And (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>The good Shepherd laieth down his ſoul for his ſheep,</hi> Joh. 10. 11. And ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I am the good Shepherd, I lay down my ſoul,</hi> Joh. 10. 15. <hi>And therefore doth my father love me,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 10, 15, 17, 18</note> 
                        <hi>becauſe I lay down my ſoul and take it again,</hi> Joh 10. 17. <hi>No man taketh it from me, I lay it down of my ſelf,</hi> ver. 18. <hi>The Son of man came to ſerve, and to give his ſoul for the ranſom of many,</hi> Mat. 20. 28. <hi>He made his ſoul a ſin,</hi> Iſa. 53. 10. <hi>and powred out his ſoul to death,</hi> Iſa. 53. 12.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Saith <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> The whole man (Chriſt) laid down his ſoul, when his ſoul departed, dying on the Croſs, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ad Tranſi. li.</hi> 3.</note> In this ſentence you ſee that <hi>Fulgentius</hi> ſpeaks of two ſouls in Chriſt. Firſt, Saith he, Chriſt laid down his (vital) ſoul. And then ſecondly, ſaith he, his (immortal) ſoul departed dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Croſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="315" facs="tcp:64895:188"/>
Fourthly, The ſoul that died in Chriſt for our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was this vital ſoul, for this kind of ſoul hath its ſeat in <note place="margin">The death of ſatisfaction was by the true bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily death of Chriſt, and not by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual death.</note> the blood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 4. and when Chriſt ſhed his blood, this ſoul of his was powred out (and then his immortal ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted) and this was typified by the vital ſoul of the beaſt, that was in the blood, of the Levitical Sacrifices, in <hi>Lev.</hi> 17. 11. and ſee <hi>Ainſ.</hi> alſo in <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 23. the ſoul of the fleſh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the Altar to make attonement for your ſouls, for it is the blood that maketh attonement for the ſoul (this I noted in the Dialogue, pag. 94.) and this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive ceremonial type was given to the Jews to exemplifie their attonement and redemption by the ſhedding of the vital ſoul that was in the blood of Chriſt; and our Saviour did confirm this to be a truth at his laſt Supper, ſaying, <hi>this cup is the New Teſtament in my blood which is ſhed for you,</hi> and for the many for the remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 28. And he was the Mediator of the New Teſtament by this death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. And his death in ver. 15, 16, 17. is exemplified by the bodily death of men, whoſe death doth make the legacies of their teſtament to be valid; and ſo in like ſort, until Chriſt had powred out his vital ſoul, his Legacies of the New Teſtament were not confirmed; but as ſoon as that act was done they were all confirmed for the many, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 27. And by his death he is ſaid to make peace or attonement, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20. as <hi>Aarons</hi> incenſe did, in <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 44. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> and by which we have redemption, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 7. and by which we are ranſomed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 28. It is this vital blood of Chriſt that cleanſeth us from all ſin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
                     <p>This vital blood of Chriſt was it that was ordained to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Gods everlaſting attonement for all our moral ſins, even as the blood of Buls, &amp;c. was ordained to procure Gods at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for their ceremonial ſins, <hi>Heb. 9. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Heb.</hi> 10.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, ſaith <hi>P. Martyr,</hi> Becauſe blood is the life, God <note place="margin">
                           <hi>P. Martyr</hi> in his com. pl. par. 2. p. 581.</note> would ſignifie that ſin is not purged by ſacrifice, unleſs it were by death.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Mr. <hi>Carlile</hi> doth thus paraphraſe on <hi>Lev.</hi> 17. 11. I have appointed the blood to be an expiation and purgation for you, even for your ſins: for it is this blood that purgeth you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="316" facs="tcp:64895:189"/>
Seventhly, From the ſpringing up of corn after it is dead in the earth, Chriſt brings a ſimilitude of his death, and of the fruit of his death, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 24. None that I can find interpret this death of any other death but the true bodily death and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, <hi>Tindal</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>Paul</hi> concludeth in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 16, 17. <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Tindals</hi> works p. 462.</note> that Chriſt muſt needs have dyed, ſaying, That whereſoever a Teſtament is, there muſt the death of the Teſtament-maker go between, or elſe the Teſtament is not ratified and ſure.</p>
                     <p>But (ſaith he) Righteouſneſs and Remiſſion of ſins in Chriſts blood is the New Teſtament, whereof hee is the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Teſtament-maker muſt needs have dyed.</p>
                     <p>And (ſaith he) he muſt, or it behoved him to die, for he took our very mortal nature for the ſame decreed council, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>It behoved that the Son of man muſt die,</hi> Joh. 12. <hi>Tindal</hi> laies the whole weight of all the bleſſings of the new Covenant on the bodily death of Chriſt; he makes no mention of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall death of Chriſts ſoul. And ſaith he in pag. 257. The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſts body and blood is the onely ſatisfaction for our ſins. And ſaith he, There is no other way to ſalvation but by Chriſts death and paſſion, and he ſpeaks this of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily death. And ſaith he, whoſoever goeth unto God, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to forgiveneſs of ſins, or ſalvation, by any other way than this, the ſame is an Heretick.</p>
                     <p>Here <hi>Tindal</hi> oppoſeth his judgement of Hereſie to Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> judgement.</p>
                     <p>Ninethly, We die a double death, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> (as I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly cited him) therefore we muſt look for a double Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; But Chriſt, ſaith he, dyed but one kind of death, therefore he roſe but one kind of Reſurrection. <hi>Adam</hi> dyed both in body and ſoul, he dyed to ſin, and to nature, &amp;c. The firſt is the death of the ſoul, the other is the death of the body, for the death of the ſoul is ſin, or everlaſting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>To us men there is a double death, and therefore we muſt have a double Reſurrection.</p>
                     <p>To Chriſt there was but one kind of death, for he ſinned not, and that one kind of death was for us; he owed no
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:64895:189"/>
kind of death, for he was not ſubject to ſin, and ſo not to death.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, <hi>Theodoret</hi> in Dialogue 3. ſaith, How could the ſoul of our Saviour, having an immortal nature, and not touched with the leaſt ſpot of ſin, be poſſibly taken with the hook of death? In theſe words he doth plainly and fully deny the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual death of Chriſts immortal ſoul, and therefore he is point blank againſt Mr. <hi>Norton.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Eleventhly, <hi>Cyril de Rectafide ad Reginas, l.</hi> 1. ſaith, If wee conceive Chriſt to be God incarnate, and ſuffering in our fleſh, the death of his fleſh alone ſufficeth for the redemption of the world.</p>
                     <p>Twelfthly, <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> and fifteen Biſhops of <hi>Africa</hi> made this confeſſion of their Faith, The death of the Son of God which he ſuffered in his fleſh alone, deſtroyed in us both our deaths, to wit, the death of the ſoul and body. But Mr. <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> holds this confeſſion made in the Dialogue to bee Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</p>
                     <p>Thirteenthly, <hi>Fulgentius ad Tranſimundum, l. 3. c.</hi> 7. ſaith, When the fleſh onely died, and was raiſed again in Chriſt, the Son of God is ſaid to have died.</p>

                        <hi>Ibidem c.</hi> 5. The fleſh dying, not onely the Deity, but the ſoul of Chriſt cannot be ſhewed to have been dead alſo.</p>

Coming to us who were in the death of the ſpirit and fleſh, Chriſt brought his ONE DEATH to us, and looſed both our deaths, his ſingle death he applied to our double death, and dying, vanquiſhed our double death.</p>
                     <p>Fifteenthly, <hi>Auguſt. in ſer.</hi> 162. ſaith, But the immortal righteous Son of God coming to die for us, in whoſe fleſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there could be no ſin, he ſuffered the puniſhment of ſin without the guilt thereof, wherefore he admitted for us the ſecond part of the firſt death, that is to ſay, the death of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy onely, by which he took from us the dominion of ſin, and the pain of eternal puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>And ſaith he, in Ser. 129. There is a firſt and a ſecond death; of the firſt death there are two parts, one when the ſinful ſoul by offending departed from her Creator; and the other where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:64895:190"/>
the ſoul for her puniſhment was excluded from the body by Gods Juſtice. The ſecond death is the everlaſting torment of body and ſoul. This diſtinction of the firſt and ſecond death Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> diſputes againſt. And in Epiſt. 99. He ſaith, Surely the ſoul of Chriſt was neither dead with any ſin, nor puniſhed with damnation, which are the two ways how the death of the ſoul may poſſibly be underſtood. But Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> hath found out a third way for the death of Chriſts ſoul by his penal Hell in this world, which he makes to have the ſame eſſential torments that are in fiery <hi>Gehenna.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>16. <hi>Beda in Homil. Feria 4. in Quadrageſima</hi> ſaith, Chriſt coming to us that were in death of Body and Spirit, ſuffered onely one death, that is the death of the fleſh, and freed us of both our deaths, he applied his ONE DEATH to our double death, and vanquiſhed them both.</p>
                     <p>17. <hi>Albinus</hi> in <hi>Quaeſt.</hi> on <hi>Geneſis</hi> ſaith, What is meant by this, <hi>Thou ſhalt die the death?</hi> It meaneth a double death in man, to wit, Soul and Body; the death of the Soul is, when God for ſin forſaketh it, the death of the Body is, when through any neceſſity the body is deprived of the ſoul. This double death of ours, Chriſt deſtroyed with his ſingle death, for he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely in the fleſh for a time, but in ſoul he never died who never ſinned.</p>
                     <p>18. <hi>Bernard ad milites Templi c.</hi> 11. ſaith, Of our two deaths, whereof the one is the deſert of ſin, the other the due puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Chriſt taking our puniſhment, but clear from ſin, whiles he dyed willingly, and onely in body, he meriteth for us life and righteouſneſs. Had Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> lived in their days, durſt he have condemned this Doctrine for Hereſie, as now he doth? I trow not, he might rather have expected a ſharp cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from them.</p>
                     <p>19. <hi>Bullenger</hi> on <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10. <hi>Homil.</hi> 153. ſaith, Whole Chriſt was the expiation of our ſins, though during that time neither his Divinity ſuffered, nor his ſoul dyed, but his fleſh, whereof the bleſſed Fathers <hi>Vigilius</hi> and <hi>Fulgentius</hi> have religiouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed againſt Hereticks.</p>
                     <p>20. No other death but a bodily death was typified, as I have ſhewed from <hi>Lev.</hi> 17. 11. and this alſo was typified by the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:64895:190"/>
death of the High Prieſt, which was ordained by Gods poſitive Law and Covenant for the redemption of the exiled perſon that was exiled by the Law for unwitting murder: for by the Law he was to continue an exile as long as the High Prieſt lived, but as ſoon as the High Prieſt was dead (be it longer or ſhorter in time) then, &amp; not till then the exiled perſon was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by redeemed from the avenger of blood, <hi>Num.</hi> 35. 25. and this makes the reaſon of the type to be the more eminent, becauſe in <note place="margin">Numb. 35. 25.</note> all other Nations the unwitting Man-ſlayer is freed at the firſt Seſſions of Juſtice; but by Gods poſitive Ordinance in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he muſt continue an exile till the death of the High Prieſt; hee could not be redeemed ſooner, nor by any other way from the danger of the avenger of blood, but onely by the death of the High Prieſt; this is an evident type of our redemption by the bodily death and ſacrifice of our High Prieſt Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>

In theſe words Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth make Chriſts body to be ſubject to death by natural cauſes, not only externally, <note place="margin">Chriſts ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorrows could not be lethal and deadly, becauſe they were governed by right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> but alſo internally from his ſoul-ſorrows, as if he might now loſe the rectitude of his own pure humane affections.</p>
                     <p>His heart indeed, according to his voluntary Covenant to undertake our nature and paſſions, did melt, for fear of his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious and painful death, in the midſt of his bowels, in his preparation to incounter it in the Garden, but after a while by his ſtrong crying and tears hee did overcome that fear, and obtained a confirmation of his nature againſt his natural fear.</p>
                     <p>But I wonder how Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> can ſay (as hee doth often) that Chriſts ſorrows were lethal and deadly, and continuing to the laſt gaſp, ſeeing all his affections were regular, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to right reaſon? can regular affections admit of ſuch a kind of ſorrow, without ſin? I think not, and yet I conceive that the meaſure of regular ſorrow may bee ſo great, that it cannot well be expreſſed by us, otherwiſe than in the Scripture phraſes, which muſt not bee ſtretched by the conceptions of men, beyond the context: But to affirm that the kind of his ſorrow was lethal and deadly of it ſelf, is as much as to ſay it was exceſſive and beyond the rule of right reaſon, which muſt needs be ſinful; and it is worſe to ſay that his lethal ſorrows
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:64895:192"/>
continued to the laſt; And therefore Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> kind of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is moſt dangerous: All Chriſts affections ſaith <hi>Martyr,</hi> were in him voluntary, they did riſe in him when he pleaſed to ſhew them, and they appeared not when he pleaſed to ſuppreſs them, but in us (ſaith he) they are often involuntary, and riſe in us whether we will or no.</p>

                     <p>Theſe three ſenſes conſidered, who dares ſay (that is well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed) that this Greek word <hi>Ethambeiſthai,</hi> in <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 33. ought to bee ſtretched to the utmoſt ſenſe of the word; theſe, and ſuch like things, I find by conference with the Septuagint in <hi>Kirkeroes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2 I wonder why Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſaith, That Phyſicians call it a <hi>Herripilation;</hi> doth hee think that Chriſt was in ſuch a dreadful diſtemper of mind and body, that it made his hair to ſtand upright? why elſe doth hee bring a name for it from that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of nature, which is called by the Phyſicians, a <hi>Horripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;</hi> I never heard that Chriſts humane nature was ſubject to diſeaſes till now: Truly Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſeems to have too mean a conceit of the perfection of Chriſts humane nature in his Agony.</p>
                     <p>3 The Text doth not ſay as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth, That Chriſt was fully amazed, in a paſſive ſenſe, but that hee began to bee amazed, in an active ſenſe, and there is as much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween being fully amazed, and beginning to be amazed, as there is between a ſound ſleep, and beginning to bee aſleep; when <hi>Peter</hi> walked on the Sea to go to Chriſt, hee began to ſink, and yet he did not ſink, <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. 30. So though Chriſt began to be amazed, yet he was not fully amazed, hee voluntarily began to be amazed in conſideration of that unnatural and terrible evil of an ignominious and violent death on the Croſs, which was now at hand to bee inflicted on him by Satan, whom God had armed with authority to do it in the moſt ignominious and violent lingring manner that he could deviſe, according to <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. to provoke his patience.</p>
                     <p>But yet he was far from being ſo amazed as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> doth make the word (according to its large ſenſe) to ſpeak: Hee ſaith that the original word ſignifieth an univerſal ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the faculties of the ſoul from their ſeveral functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; what though the word in the largeſt extent doth ſignifie ſo much?</p>
                     <p>Yet I ſay alſo, that Chriſt was not ſo amazed; he was not fully overcome with fear, as men amazed are; for if all the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:64895:193"/>
faculties of his ſoul had now ceaſed univerſally from their ſeveral functions (as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> affirmeth) then how could Chriſt at this very inſtant have behaved himſelf ſo Religiouſly and adviſedly as he did? for now hee uttered words of reaſon, and underſtanding, words of counſel and advice to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, even at the ſame time when hee began to bee amazed, telling his Diſciples in what manner hee began to bee amazed, he ſaid unto them, <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful, even to death,</hi> or even to conſider the manner of my uſage in the time of my death, <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. 33. 34. or thus, I am ſurrounded with the ſorrows of death, as I have opened the Greek word a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 38. And then alſo hee ſaid unto his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples (as one that had the uſe of his intellects) <hi>Tarry yee here and watch me;</hi> or as <hi>Luke</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>Watch and pray, that yee enter not into temptation,</hi> Luke 22. 40. and then hee went a little forward, and fell on the ground, and prayed, <hi>That if it were poſſible that hour</hi> (of his dread) <hi>might paſſe from him,</hi> namely, his natural dread of that Satanical uſage that was at hand, verſ. 34, 35.</p>
                     <p>Do not all theſe circumſtances of his wiſe and religious deportment prove that he was not amazed, though at firſt he did voluntarily begin to bee amazed. Methinks a judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Divine ſhould look as well into the circumſtances of the Text, as into the large ſenſe of the word. Methinks a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Divine ſhould know and beleeve, that Chriſt had at this time all the powers and faculties of reaſon, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in a far more excellent meaſure than any other man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever that is in his beſt ſenſes, and that the faculties of his ſoul were ſo perfect, that they could not ceaſe univerſally from their ſeveral functions in the time of executing his office.</p>
                     <p>All his paſſions were voluntary, and followed the rule of right reaſon, ſaith <hi>Damaſen,</hi> and therefore he could not bee ſo amazed as Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> definition doth charge Chriſt to bee.</p>
                     <p>4 Let us try the ſenſe that is given to the word by other Tranſlators, who minded the ſenſe of the Context more than the largeſt extent of the word.</p>

                     <p>2 The Seventy uſe this Greek word to explain the Chalde word in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 7. which we tranſlate Terrible, and ſo terrible was the apprehenſion of an ignominious violent death to Chriſts humane nature.</p>
                     <p>3 The Seventy uſe this Greek word to tranſlate the Hebrew word, which we tranſlate Haſte; namely ſuch a haſte as ariſeth from the ſudden fear of death, and of ſuch like evils, as in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7. 15.</p>
                     <p>This Hebrew word ſaith <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 3. implies a trembling, and a haſty flight from the fear of danger, as in <hi>Deut. 20. 3.

But yet this is to be noted, that his fear or amazement was not in ſuch a degree as Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> definition doth hold forth, for if all the faculties of his ſoul had now ceaſed univerſally from their ſeveral functions, then <hi>David</hi> had not been capable to contrive ſuch a wiſe courſe for his ſafety, as he did on a ſudden.</p>

                     <p>The thing I aim at by citing all theſe Tranſlations, is, to ſhew that Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> definition of the word <hi>Amazed,</hi> in <hi>Mark.</hi> 14. 33. is larger than theſe Tranſlations above cited do make it to be, and larger than the context will own.</p>
                     <p>I do not think therefore that Chriſt was ever under ſuch a degree of amazement as Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> definition holds forth.</p>
                     <p>6 Neither is his compariſon ſuitable to expreſs that Chriſt was ſo amazed; for Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> compares the univerſal ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the exerciſe of all the faculties of Chriſts immortal ſoul from their ſeveral functions in his amazement, to the ceſſation of the intellectual faculties in the time of ſound ſleeping; any man may ſee that this compariſon is no way fit: for though the Intellects ceaſe from exerciſe during the time of ſound ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, yet that is but to refreſh nature for the better perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance <note place="margin">By conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth impute the ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

have ſhewed in the opening of <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 28, 30. in Chap. 4. Sect. 8. He could not be any further amazed than his perfect rational Will thought moſt ſuitable to the conditions of his Covenant, which was to be touched with a quick ſenſe of our paſſions when he would, and as much as he would; The Devil indeed did labor to deprive him of his reaſonable ſoul, as it is evident by his plotting of his ignominious and violent death, and he labored to bring him into ſuch amaze, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſpeaks of, and if he could have effected it, he had won the victory; but bleſſed be God, this wiſe ſervant was never no otherwiſe amazed but as himſelf pleaſed to trouble himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 33.

                  <p>If the circumſtances of this Agony be well weighed (ſaith the Dialogue) it will appear, that it did not proceed from his Fathers wrath, but from his natural fear of death onely; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he muſt be ſtricken with the fear of death, as much as his true humane nature could bear; he muſt be touched with the fear of death in a very great meaſure (as the Prophets did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel)</p>
                  <p>Add to theſe pains of his mind, his earneſt prayers to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from his natural fear of death; the fear of death doth often cauſe men to ſweat, and earneſt prayer doth often cauſe men to ſweat.</p>
                  <p>As he was man he muſt be touched with the fear of death, for a time, and as he was Mediator he muſt fully and wholly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his natural fear of death by his prayers; therefore there was a neceſſity for him to ſtrive in prayer, until he had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it.</p>

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 19. I have already replyed to this very anſwer in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in the firſt Section of this Chapter: But yet I reply fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Dialogue, That the law of Mediatorſhip did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that he ſhould take our nature, together with our true natural (but yet ſinleſs) infirmities, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. and ſeeing he was conceived of the ſeed of the woman by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, our nature and natural affections were tranſcendent in him, and therefore according to thoſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:64895:197"/>
natural paſſions, he could not chuſe but abhor death, more than any ſinful man, and therefore he did often trouble himſelf with the thought of it, as he made it evident by his ſpeeches often itterated to his Diſciples about his ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous death and ſufferings at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but at his laſt Supper, and in the Garden, when his death was nigh at hand, he did more pathetically expreſs his natural dread and abhorrence of it, firſt to his Diſciples, and then to God in his prayers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 37, 38. for he knew by Gods declared will in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. that God had armed the Devil with power to apprehend him, to condemn him, and to put him to that ignominious torturing death of the croſs, as a ſinful malefactor.</p>
                     <p>I ſay the conſideration of this uſage could not chuſe but work a greater dread and abhorring in the humane nature of Chriſt, than the like can do to us, becauſe of the pure conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of his nature, as I have noted it in Sect. 1. Our nature by reaſon of original ſin is become the ſlave of death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. and therefore we cannot abhor it with ſo much true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural deteſtation, as the pure nature of Chriſt might do and did, and therefore his natural fear of death was tranſcendent to ours.</p>
                     <p>But ſaith he, Penal ſpiritual death is a greater object incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably, he takes it for granted that Chriſt ſuffered a penal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual death, which is denied: But in caſe ſuch a Tenent were i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply</hi> 20. The Dialogue ſhews plainly, that the approach of his ignominious and painful death by his Combater Satan, was the main cauſe of his exceeding natural fear, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of his Agony: But,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in order to overcome that fear, the Dialogue doth make his godly fear in his rational ſoul by putting up ſtrong prayers, with cryes and tears, for the overcoming of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fear, to be another ground that did increaſe his violent ſweat in his Agony.</p>
                     <p>And thirdly, I makes his pious care to perform all the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that were written of him, in exact obedience in all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to the Laws of the Combate, without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion by Satans provocations, to bee another circumſtance that did aggravate his zeal in his prayers, and ſo it was a helping cauſe to increaſe his ſweat in his Agony: But mark this, the Dialogue doth ſtill make his natural fear of death to be the foundation of all this; and therefore I know no juſt cauſe given why Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſhould ſay, That my words are a ſecret acknowledgement, that his fear of a natural death, was not a ſufficient cauſe of his exceeding ſorrows before his death. <note place="margin">Natural death is the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin, but Chriſts hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature was not by that juſtice ſubjected to death.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>2 I cannot chuſe but wonder that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth ſo often charge the Dialogue to ſpeak of Chriſts natural death only, ſeeing the Dialogue doth ſhun that word as altogether unfit to expreſs the formality of his death, as I have ſhewed at Reply 5. This is a plain evidence, That Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth not underſtand the drift of the Dialogue about the true nature of Chriſts death; natural death is that bodily death which was
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:64895:198"/>
by Gods poſitive juſtice inflicted on fallen <hi>Adam,</hi> as the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of original ſin, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. which is now natural to us; this is a true deſcription of natural death; But Chriſts hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, was not made ſubject to death by the curſe of that ſupreme poſitive Law, becauſe he was free from orginal ſin, and ſo free from the curſe of that Law, for ſin is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, where there is no Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 13. But by another po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Law and Covenant, wherein hee was an equal and reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal Covenanter. Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> having gone aſtray in his firſt foundation-propoſition, he ſtrayes further and further from the true nature of Chriſts death and ſacrifice; firſt, he ſaith, That all the curſes of the Law are heaped together, and laid upon Chriſt: And then in page 83. and in divers other places, hee ſtrayes further and further, till hee make the death of Chriſt in the formality of it to be his ſubjection to that curſed bodily death that was inflicted on fallen <hi>Adam</hi> for their original ſin in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. But I hope I have ſufficiently ſhewed in Reply 3. and 5. a little before, and elſewhere, That the death of Chriſt was not a natural death, but a death of Covenant only, or elſe it could not have been a ſacrifice for the procuring of Gods Attonement to the Elect, which no other mans natural death in the world is beſides: And therefore the Dialogue doth rightly argue in page 6. that the death of Chriſt is not inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in that curſed death that was threatned to fallen <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. But it was declared to be of another nature, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified to <hi>Adam</hi> by the death of ſome Lamb offered in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the breaking of the Devils Head-plot, four verſes before, namely in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.</p>

And ſo Chriſt with excellent wraſtling wraſtled it out with Satan; He fought the good fight and kept to the Rule of obedience, in his fears and prayers; and ſuch kind of prayers do often cauſe men to ſweat, though they have the Spirit but by meaſure; how much more fervent then was Chriſt in his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in his Agony in the Garden, which had the Spirit above meaſure (as the Dialogue doth argue) it is no marvel then, that his prayers which were uttered with ſtrong cryes and tears, did increaſe his ſweat in his Agony, until it trickled down like as it were great drops of blood. Nature it ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the gracious actings of Gods Spirit, may ſtrive it ſelf into a ſweaty Agony, as the Phyſician that wrote the book <hi>de utili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Reſpirationis</hi> (among <hi>Gallens</hi> Works, <hi>Attribut. Tom.</hi> 7.) ſaith, It ſometimes happeneth, that ſervent ſpirits do ſo dilate the pores of the body that blood paſſeth by them, and ſo the ſweat may be bloody: Hence I reaſon thus; If a natural man may bee thus fervent in ſpirits till his ſweat may bee bloody; then why might not Chriſt, that had his natural fervency increaſed <note place="margin">Alſo in Reply 24. you may ſee an example of a bloody ſweat cauſed through the ſudden fear of an ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous death.</note> in his prayers by the Spirit above meaſure, provoke a bloody ſweat from his body? and therefore the reaſoning of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue is ſound and good, which runs; If the natural fear of death, and the ſtriving of the Spirit in prayer may cauſe men to ſweat, then it might cauſe our Saviours pure humane nature to ſweat, much more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it follows in the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</p>
                     <p>4 Conſider how terrible to nature death is at ſometimes; but at ſometimes again not terrible: After our Saviour had finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his prayers in the Garden, hee ſaid to his Diſciples in <hi>Matth.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 46.</note> 26. 46. <hi>Ariſe, let us be going,</hi> namely, to meet that ignominious death, that a little before was ſo dreadful to my humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it put me into an Agony, but now I have obtained a confirmation to my nature againſt thoſe fears, and therefore <note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Hall</hi> in his Select Thoughts, p. 139.</note> now I ſay unto you, <hi>Ariſe, let us go meet it:</hi> Which till he had prayed (ſaith <hi>Trap)</hi> he greatly feared: And ſaith Dr. <hi>Hall,</hi> the fear of death is natural, and ſo far from being evil, that it was

                     <p>Obſerve, I pray, That Dr. <hi>Hall</hi> doth ſpeak this of Chriſts natural fear of his bodily death.</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly, This alſo is worthy of due obſervation, that Chriſt muſt overcome his natural fear of death before hee could make his vital ſoul a ſacrifice, according to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, for it was Gods command, and his own Covenant alſo, that he ſhould not ſuffer any to take away his vital ſoul from him.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, Into his paſſive agony, or rather into his active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſive agony, from the time of his apprehenſion to his death on the croſs.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 I will ſpeak of his active agony; and that was begun in ſome degree before his laſt Supper, as it is evident by <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 27. with <hi>Joh. 13. 1. Now is my ſoul troubled, and what ſhall I ſay? Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

And hence it follows by theſe two Scriptures compared, that his conflicting affections were active; for his ſenſitive will was in an abſolute ſubjection to his rational will, in which he was the abſolute Lord Commander of all his affections, they did his will at his beck; and this excellent property belongs onely to the humane nature of Chriſt, it is his perſonal priviledge; for our natural paſſions in him were above our natural power, becauſe nature in him did never go before his will, as <hi>Damaſen</hi> ſpeaks in Reply 26.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The thought of his ſufferings was much in his mind when he was at his laſt Supper; and therefore while he was at Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per he bad <hi>Judas</hi> to do what he had to do quickly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 27. and when <hi>Judas</hi> was gone about his treachery, he did manifeſt that he had very ſad apprehenſions of what evils he was to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; for Supper being ended, and Jeſus knowing that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had given all things into his hands, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 3. namely, knowing that the Father had given the management of the whole combate into the hands of his true humane nature, as it was accompanied with true humane paſſions, He knew it was his duty to ſtir up his true humane conflicting affections, in a more eminent manner than other men, at the approach of his ignominious and painful ſufferings, according to the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and tender conſtitution of his nature, above the nature of other men.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 It is alſo evident, that the expreſſions of the two Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> do relate to the ſame agony that <hi>Luke</hi> doth: and therefore <hi>Tindal</hi> doth tranſlate <hi>[Ademonein] Mat.</hi> 26. 37. and in <hi>Mark.</hi> 14. 33. (which we tranſlate very heavy) by the word <hi>Agony</hi> in both places, juſt as he doth <hi>[Agon]</hi> in <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 44. But as ſoon as Chriſt had obtained a confirmation againſt his ſaid natural fear, by his earneſt prayers in the Garden, then his inward agony by his conflicting affections had an end; I ſay, after he had by his earneſt prayers obtained a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he never had any more conflicting affections in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of thoſe evils he was to ſuffer, as he had before he had prayed, as I have formerly noted it: But as ſoon as he had obtained his requeſt by his earneſt prayers, then he came to his Diſciples and ſaid to them (as a reſolved Champion) <hi>Come, the hour is come, Behold the Son of man is betrayed into the

hands of ſinners. Riſe up, let us go, Mark.</hi> 14. 41, 42. namely, let us not <note place="margin">Mar. 14. 41, 42.</note> riſe up to run away through fear, but let us go and meet thoſe arch-Inſtruments of Satan, the ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> as <hi>Ainſw.</hi> calls them, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 13. or as <hi>Trap</hi> ſaith in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 46. Riſe, let us be going to meet that death, which till he had prayed (ſaith he) he greatly feared; Or, let us go meet my Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Satan. He ſpeaks theſe words after the manner of a coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Champion that is going to ſtrive with his Antagoniſt for the maſtery; and the ſequel ſhows that from this time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he reſiſted his Combater Satan unto blood; for it was counted a ſhame for ſuch as undertook to be Combaters, to yeeld before any blood was drawn; and indeed ſuch combats as were undertaken for the tryal of the maſtery, were ſeldom determined without blood. And accordingly he that did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome his Antagoniſt without tranſgreſſing the voluntary Laws of the Combat, was reputed by the Maſters of the game to be a lawful victor, and he did thereby merit the prize; and unto this ouſtom the Apoſtle doth allude in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1, 2, 3. Ye <note place="margin">Heb. 1 2. 1, 2, 3.</note> have not yet reſiſted unto blood, ſtriving againſt ſin. Look therefore unto the example of that Combater, Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Captain and conſervator (as <hi>Ainſ.</hi> renders the word in <hi>Lev.</hi> 8. 22.) of our Faith, <hi>Who for the joy that was ſet before him, indured the croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame, and is now ſeated</hi> (with honor as a conqueror) <hi>at the right hand of the Throne of God;</hi> for he indured (as the godly many times do) a great combate or fight of afflictions, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 32.</p>
                     <p>Such voluntary Laws and Covenants, as were uſually made by the Maſters of the Olympick, and <hi>Roman</hi> Combates, and ſuch voluntary Combaters as did conſent to obey the ſaid Laws and Covenants, do ſomewhat exemplifie my meaning, when I do ſo often ſpeak of the voluntary Covenant between the Trinity, and of the voluntary undertaking of the ſeed of the woman, to enter the Liſts, and to combate with the arch-enemy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, in obedience to thoſe poſitive Laws and Covenants that were made between the Trinity for winning the prize of mans redemption.</p>

therefore after hee was returned to his Palace, hee remained faſting, and ſuffered no inſtruments of muſick to bee brought before him, and his ſleep went from him, verſ. 18. all this doth evidence the greatneſs of his inward agony with his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting thoughts and affections, of fear and ſorrow, for the great danger of <hi>Daniels</hi> life.</p>
                     <p>Theſe, and ſuch like inſtances, do ſomewhat direct us how to underſtand the true ground and cauſe of Chriſts agony; both of his internal agony in his ſenſitive ſoul in the Garden, and of his external agony by his combate of ſufferings from Satan and his inſtruments, from his apprehenſion to his death on the Croſs; and how he was to conquer them by his conſtant patience, and by his perſeverance in all obedience to the poſitive Laws of the combate, before he could make his ſoul an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 I will yet more largely open Chriſts agony, by opening the plot of the Trinity for mans redemption, as it is declared in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.

                     <p>And ſecondly, In declaring the victory to go on Chriſts ſide by his obedience to the Laws of the Combate, even when the Devil by his malicious ſtratagems ſhould peirce him in the foot-ſoals.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 God told the Devil in the Serpent, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. that he would put an utter enmity between him and the ſeed of the deceived woman; and that he ſhould have his full liberty to uſe him as a ſinful Malefactor, and (at laſt) to peirce him in the foot-ſoals, and that hee ſhould have his full liberty to enter the Liſts, and try maſteries with his humane nature, as it was accompanied with our true natural infirmities, to the end that he might try the beſt of skill, if by any means he could bring this ſeed of the woman into any diſobedience to the Laws of the Combate, as he had done with <hi>Adam</hi> in his Innocency.</p>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> in page 19. and in page 218. doth ſpoyl the true ſenſe of this word Seed of the woman (called <hi>Hee,</hi> and <hi>Him)</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. by interpreting it in a collective ſenſe of Chriſt, and his members; whereas it ſhould bee interpreted only of the individual perſon of Chriſt, as he is the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and publick head of his Elect Church; as Mr. <hi>Rutherſurd</hi> on the
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:64895:202"/>
Covenant, page 312. hath rightly expounded the word Seed, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. and his reaſons there alleged may ſerve to prove the like ſenſe of the word Seed, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
                     <p>Moreover God told the Devil, that hee might look to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as well as hee could, that this ſeed of the deceived woman, ſhould by his perfect obedience to the Laws of the Combate, conquer him in all his deſigns, and at laſt make his ſoul a moſt perfect obedient ſacrifice; by which perfection of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, both in his Combate and Sacrifice, he ſhould break in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces his firſt grand Head-plot; for his firſt grand Head-plot was to intice <hi>Adam</hi> to eat the forbidden fruit (contrary to Gods voluntary poſitive prohibition) and thereby to inwrap him, and all his natural poſterity into the ſame ſpiritual death of original ſin: But yet for all this, God told the Devil, that hee would raiſe up a ſeed from this deceived ſinful woman, that ſhould conquer him by his moſt perfect and exact obedience to another voluntary poſitive Law, that ſhould be more hard and difficult to be performed than <hi>Adams</hi> was by infinite degrees, and that was firſt to enter the Liſts with Satan and his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and not to bee diſturbed in his patience, but to obſerve the laws of the Combate in all obedience, and at laſt (when the Devil had done his worſt) he ſhould then make his vital ſoul a ſacrifice in breathing out his immortal ſoul by his own Prieſtly power; and all this is comprehended in this ſentence, <hi>Hee ſhall break thy head:</hi> and by this ſpeech, God did fully fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn the Devil, that he might uſe his beſt skill without any reſtraint, to do what he could to diſturb the patience of this ſeed of the woman, either by his ſinful imputations, or by his ignominious uſage, or by his cruel tortures, and ſo might do his utmoſt to interrupt his obedience, that ſo his death might not be a ſacrifice, and that ſo by this means he might ſave his Head-plot from being broken, and accordingly the Devil did often ſtir up his Arch-inſtruments to diſturb his patience, but eſpecially when he entred into <hi>Judas</hi> to fetch a band of armed men with ſwords and ſtaves to apprehend him as a notorious Malefactor, and ſtirred up the Scribes to accuſe him as a moſt ſinful Malefactor, worſe than the murtherer <hi>Barabas,</hi> and he ſtirred up <hi>Herod,</hi> and his Souldiers, to mock him, and <hi>Pilate</hi> to condemn him to the moſt ſhameful curſed death of the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:64895:202"/>
Croſs; and all this evil uſage is included in this ſentence, <hi>Thou</hi> (Satan) <hi>ſhalt peirce him in the foot-ſoals.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in this Combate this is chiefly to be marked, That the Devil did uſe all the fouleſt play that hee could deviſe to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the patience of this Seed of the woman that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about with our true natural affections and paſſions, and with a tender ſenſe of every evil, for the Devil knew that if he could by all his foul play, but once have diſturbed his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that then he had perverted him in the courſe of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and then hee knew that hee ſhould have ſpoyled his death from being a ſacrifice, and then he knew that hee ſhould have preſerved his firſt grand Head-plot from being broken; and then the Devil would have triumphed over Chriſt upon the Croſs, and over all mankind, as he did when he firſt brought <hi>Adam</hi> to diſobey Gods poſitive prohibition in eating the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 God was pleaſed further to declare, That it was the plot of the Trinity, that the ſecond perſon ſhould take unto him the ſeed of the deceived ſinful woman; and that he ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Liſts with his enemy Satan, in that nature, as it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with true natural paſſions, and not in the power of his divine nature, and therefore it was of neceſſity that he muſt manifeſt the truth of his humane nature by his true natural affections and paſſions, in fearing, and ſorrowing, and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his vilde ignominious uſage by his Combater Satan; and if it be marked, Chriſt doth as much complain of his ſhameful uſage, as of his painful uſage; and that he ſaith in <hi>Pſal. 69. 20. Reproach hath broken my heart;</hi> and yet ſtill, that, notwithſtanding all Satans vilde uſage, hee ſhould continue obedient to the very laſt, even to the moſt ſhameful death of the Croſs, and that hee ſhould then make his vital ſoul a ſacrifice of Redemption and Reconciliation for all the Elect. And thus as by the demerit of <hi>Adams</hi> diſobedience to a meer poſitive Law, <hi>The Many</hi> (even the Elect as wel as the Reprobate) were made ſinners, ſo by the merit of the obedience of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> to Gods meer poſitive Law in his combate with Satan, and in his death and ſacrifice, <hi>The Many are made righteous,</hi> Rom. 5. 18, 19. that is to ſay, <note place="margin">Rom 5. 18, 19.</note> They are juſtified from the condemning power of ſin by Gods Reconciliation for the ſake of Chriſts obedience in
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:64895:203"/>
his combate of ſufferings, and in his death and ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>And indeed how elſe could his humane nature be better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and exemplified, than by his fear and heavineſs at the nigh approach of his ignominious and muſt cruel unnatural death? and how elſe could his obedience be better proved and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified to be moſt perfect, than by his moſt perfect patience under ſuch an ignominious and cruel uſage, and therefore by his conſtancy in his patience and obedience through the whole combate with Satan, he got the victory over Satan, and won the prize that was ſet before him, by the Maſters of the combate, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8, 9. and this God declared firſt in <hi>Gen. 3. 15. He ſhall break thy head-plot.</hi> In theſe words God declared that the <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 8, 9. Gen. 3. 15. Heb. 2. 10.

And Chriſt is called our Captain, becauſe all good Chriſtians are called his Souldiers, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 3, 4. And therefore in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15.

He is <note place="margin">Iſa 53. 12.

mankind, under his power, as his ſpoil; yet now at the laſt Chriſt by his conſtant patience and obedience, notwithſtanding all Satans provocations, hath got the victory again over Satan, and by that means he pacified Gods wrath for the Elect, and reſcued them from being Satans ſpoil; to be his ſpoil. And thus you ſee how Chriſt hath divided the ſpoil, as <hi>David</hi> did when he conquered the <hi>Amalekites, 1 Sam.</hi> 30. and this dividing of the ſpoyl is always done with joy for the victory, as in <hi>Judg. 5. 30.

                     <p>Theſe and ſuch like Sciptures do fully declare unto us where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the true nature of Chriſts agony doth conſiſt, namely, in his combate with his ignominious anſwer from his malicious combater Satan, both his inward agony in the Garden, when he was ſurrounded with great fear, and with great heavineſs, it was in relation to his outward agony by his combate of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings from Satan on the croſs; and alſo the true nature of his conqueſt is ſet out by that victorious weapon of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, his conſtant and exact patience and obedience, and no Scripture doth mention his ſufferings to be from Gods Judgement ſeat, in the way of legal proceedings from Gods immediate wrath, though the Devil took that courſe to make him a legal ſinner before <hi>Pilats</hi> judgement ſeat.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The Devil having had this open warning by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of an utter enmity, namely, that the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould by his patience and obedience under all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the combate, break his head-plot; he took the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and therefore he neglected no time, but took the very firſt opportunity to diſturb the patience, and to ſpoil the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the ſeed of the woman, even as ſoon as ever he was intrinſecally inſtalled into the Mediators Office (which was done at his baptiſm) and then Chriſt alſo was led by the Spirit of God (that annointed him, and inſtalled him with gifts for his Office) into the wilderneſs on purpoſe to try Maſteries with the Devil; and there the Devil continued to tempt him by all the ſleights he could deviſe for forty daies together, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not prevail in thoſe forty days, therefore when the ſaid forty days were ended, he grew to be more deſperate (than formerly) in his temptations, and according to the grant of his power (which was unlimited) over the body of

But ſtill the Devil loſt his labor, becauſe Chriſts obedience was unconquerable, for by his patience and obedience he reſiſted the Devil in all his temptations; and after the Devil had ſpent his skill in theſe three notable temptations, he is ſaid to leave him for a ſeaſon, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 14. but it was but for a ſhort ſeaſon, for in verſ. 16. when our Savior came to <hi>Nazaret</hi> where he had been brought up, he went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day, and ſtood up to read; and at laſt he ſaid thus to them, <hi>No Prophet is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in his own Country,</hi> verſ. 24. <hi>And then all in the Synagogue when they heard theſe things were filled with wrath</hi> (for the Devil did now provoke their corrupt natures thereto) <hi>and they roſe up and thrust him out of the City, and led him to the brow of the hill, that they might caſt him down headlong,</hi> verſ. 28, 29. and ever after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually the Devil did nothing elſe but raiſe up moſt vild ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous accuſations againſt him, and often moved the Phariſees to take him and put him to death.</p>
                     <p>4 The Devil did yet more eagerly enter the liſts with Chriſt, at his laſt Supper, and ſo on to the Garden; for at his laſt ſupper he ſaid thus to his Diſciples, <hi>Hereafter I will not talk much with you, for the Prince of this world commeth, Joh.</hi> 14. 30. For juſt now <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 30.</note> he hath taken away <hi>Judas</hi> from our ſociety to fetch a Band of armed men from the High-Prieſts to apprehend me as a ſinful malefactor; and therefore I fore-tel you that the Prince of this world commeth now to aſſault me more fiercely than ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, So that hereafter I cannot talk much with you, as now I do. Of which more hereafter.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth make this Agony of Chriſt to be his conflicting paſſions with his Fathers vindicative wrath; therefore it is needful ere we go any further to examine ſuch Scriptures as are brought for the proof of it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The firſt Scripture I will begin with, is in <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 31. This Scripture hath been objected to me by ſome of note, to prove <note place="margin">Matth. 26, 31.</note>
                        <pb n="347" facs="tcp:64895:204"/>
that God himſelf did ſmite Chriſt the Shepherd of the ſheep, by his immediate vindicative wrath.</p>
                     <p>The context lies thus, When Chriſt was at Supper with his Diſciples, his true humane nature was much exerciſed with the thought of his ignominious and cruel uſage, which Satan was ready to bring upon him; as it appear: by his ſpeeches to his Diſciples, <hi>All ye</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>ſhall be offended becauſe of me this night: For it is written, I will ſmite the Shepherd, and the ſheep of the flock ſhall be ſcattered, Matth.</hi> 26. 31. This <hi>[I]</hi> hath been expounded to me by ſome of note, to be God, and ſo it is; but withall they expound it to be Gods ſmiting of Chriſts ſoul with his immediate wrath. But this I deny, for theſe words muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded from <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 7. and then the caſe will be altered, <note place="margin">Zach. 13. 7.</note> for the words in <hi>Zachary</hi> runs thus, <hi>Smite thou the ſhepherd,</hi> there the word <hi>[Thou,]</hi> is put for the word <hi>[I]</hi> in <hi>Matthew,</hi> and this difference is obſerved by Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> in his preface to <hi>Geneſis;</hi> ſo that in <hi>Zachary</hi> God ſaith to Satan, <hi>ſmite thou the Shepherd;</hi> Smite him as a ſinful malefactor and ſpare not, do thy worſt to diſturb his patience, &amp;c. God ſpeaks thus to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in <hi>Zachary,</hi> juſt as he did in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. Thou Satan ſhalt peirce the ſeed of the woman in the foot-ſoals as a wicked malefactor.

therefore <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Lord hath taken away my cattle, and my children,</hi> Job 1.

And in this ſenſe the word <hi>[I]</hi> muſt be underſtood in <hi>Matthew; I will ſinite the ſhepherd;</hi> that is to ſay, I God will give Satan leave to ſmite the ſhepherd.

                     <p>The ſecond Scripture to be examined is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10. <hi>It pleaſed</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>the Lord to bruiſe him, and to put him to grief, when he ſhall ſet out, or give his ſoul to be a Treſpaſs Offering,</hi> or as the Seventy read it, <hi>a ſin,</hi> For this phraſe <hi>ſet,</hi> ſee <hi>Ainſ.</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 27. 37. and in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>and Gen.</hi> 9. 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17. 5.</p>
                     <p>This Scripture being rightly interpreted, doth not mean that God was pleaſed to bruiſe Chriſt actively, and ſo to put him to grief by his immediate wrath; But it means that it pleaſed the Lord paſſively to put, that is to permit and ſuffer Satan to bruiſe him, and to put him to grief, and ſo ſpeaks our larger Annotation on theſe words, <hi>He put him to grief,</hi> or (as ſome ſaith the Annotation) he ſuffered him to be put to pain or torment, becauſe this form (ſaith the Annotation) hath oft in it a notion of permiſſion, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 33. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 10, 116. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 17. and ſee more for this form in Reply 22. and in <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 39. 9. and in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 16. 10.</p>
                     <p>In this ſenſe, I ſay, It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe Chriſt, and to put him to grief, and juſt ſo it pleaſed the Lord to put an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enmity between the Devil and the ſeed of the deceived ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful woman, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. there the Lord appointed the Devil by <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> his permiſſive Commiſſion to combate for the victory with the ſeed of the woman; and in caſe the Devil could prevail to diſturb his patience, then the Victory was to go on his ſide, but
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:64895:205"/>
in caſe the ſeed of the woman did perſevere in his patience and obedience through all the Devils ignominious trials, and at laſt in that perfect obedience did make his vital ſoul a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice by breathing out his immortal ſoul by his own Prieſtly power, then the victory was to go on his ſide, and then hee was to have the prize, namely, the Redemption of all the Elect.</p>
                     <p>And in this ſenſe alſo is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 5. to bee underſtood, <hi>He was</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>wounded for our trangreſsions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities:</hi> God may be ſaid to do this (though not from his immediate wrath) becauſe he permitted Satan to do all this, as I have expounded theſe words formerly.</p>
                     <p>And in this ſenſe it is ſaid in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 27. <hi>They perſecuted him whom thou haſt ſmitten:</hi> God is here ſaid to ſmite Chriſt, but yet not from his immediate wrath, but by Satan and his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, God permitted Satan to do his worſt to Chriſt, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the perfection of his obedience for his Prieſtly conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his ſacrifice; but the Devils end was to diſturb his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſo to pervert him in his obedience, that ſo his death might not be a ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>And thus it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, and put him to grief, namely, by Satan and his Inſtruments, and not by Gods immediate wrath; And this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> beleeve is the plain genuine ſenſe of <hi>Iſaiah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And becauſe I judge this interpretation to bee of neceſſary conſequence, I will once more repeat it with ſome inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>It pleaſed the Lord, according to the counſel of his own will (which hee firſt declared to us in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.) to permit Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to enter the Liſts with the ſeed of the deceived woman, to deceive him if he could; and to that end he gave him his full liberty to deceive him by fraud, or to provoke him by force to ſome ſinful diſturbance or other: And thus it pleaſed the Lord to permit Satan to bruiſe him, and to put him to grief, by an ignominious and long lingring violent death, to diſturb his patience and obedience if hee could, even at the ſame time, when his ſoul ſhall ſet, or give it ſelf to bee a Treſpaſs-offering, that ſo hee might ſpoyl his death from being a ſacrifice if he could and thereby might ſave his firſt grand Head-plot from
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:64895:206"/>
being broken: And it pleaſed the Lord alſo according to the counſel of his own will, to Covenant to, and with the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that in caſe he held conſtant in his obedience, through all Satans malicious ſtratagems, and at laſt in that perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence did give his ſoul to be a Treſpaſs-offering, then his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in his ſaid ſufferings ſhould be for his perfect conſecration, and then his death ſhould be accepted as an acceptable ſacrifice of Reconciliation for all the Elect, and then Gods Covenant with him was that hee ſhould ſee his ſeed, and prolong his dayes, and that the pleaſure of the Lord for mans actual Regeneration, and Reconciliation, ſhould proſper in his hands.</p>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth often torment this heavenly ſenſe of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> with a contrary, for hee makes Chriſt to combate with Gods immediate wrath, and to ſuffer as a legal ſinner, and as our legal Surety from the judicial vindicative wrath of God, even from his judicial vindicative Judgement-ſeat, as in page 55, 63, 85, 122, 143, 165, 192, 213, 39, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>To this interpretation I Reply; That Gods not ſparing his Son, but delivering him up for us all, muſt not bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Gods delivering him up to his own immediate wrath, as Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> ſenſe doth carry it: But of Gods delivering him up to his Combater Satan, that ſo Satan might have his full liberty to do his worſt unto him to provoke his patience, and ſo to pervert him in his obedience by his ignominious and cruel uſage, that ſo he might ſpoyl his death from being a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice if he could, and that ſo hee might hinder him from breaking his firſt grand Head-plot: In this ſenſe God ſpared not his Son, but gave him up for us all, and in this ſenſe, God gave Satan liberty to uſe <hi>Pilate</hi> as his inſtrument to make Chriſt bear our ſins in his body on the Tree, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24.

Secondly, Others underſtand it of the Generation of his elect number.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, But I beleeve it muſt bee underſtood of his wicked Satanical Generation, for <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> did call them, <hi>A gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Vipers,</hi> Mat. 3.

But not for himſelf,</hi> ſaith <hi>Daniel,</hi> that is to ſay, Not for his own ſinful nature, nor for his ſinful life: And to theſe two Scriptures do the words of Chriſt allude, when hee ſaid to his Diſciples at his laſt Supper, <hi>The Prince of this world cometh</hi> (with a band of armed ſouldiers to apprehend mee for a Malefactor) <hi>but he hath nothing in me,</hi> Joh. 14. 30. no original corruption, nor no actual tranſgreſſion againſt the laws of the <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 30.</note> Combate.</p>
                  <p>Why then was he taken by wicked hands?</p>
                  <p>God doth anſwer by <hi>Iſa. 53. 8. For the tranſgreſsion of my people was hee ſtricken, wounded and bruiſed on the Croſs:</hi> God would have his obedience declared to be perfected by this means, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would accept his death as a ſacrifice of Satisfaction and Reconciliation <hi>for the tranſgreſsion of his people;</hi> and then it follows in verſe 9. <hi>That he made his grave with the wicked;</hi> This <hi>Mark</hi> expounds thus, <hi>Hee was numbred with the wicked, Mar. 15. 28. and with the rich in his death,</hi> for he was buried in rich <hi>Ioſephs</hi> Sepulchre.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Scriptures thus expounded, and many ſuch like which might be alleged, muſt have the ſame ſenſe, namely, according to Gods firſt declaration in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. which will eminently ſhew, how God is ſaid to do all the afflictions of Chriſt, namely, (not from his immediate wrath, but) becauſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:64895:207"/>
to the voluntary Covenant and Council of the bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, he proclaimed a combate of enmity between Satan, the arch enemy of mankind, and the ſeed of the deceived wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, Becauſe he gave the Devil a commiſſion to do his worſt to diſturb his patience, and ſo to pervert his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>3 God may be ſaid to do all the ſoul-ſufferings of Chriſt, becauſe he appointed him to take on him the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and mans true natural affections and paſſions, and ſo to be inwardly touched with the ſence of Satans ignominious and unnatural uſage, and to manifeſt it to his Diſciples in a high degree, according to the moſt excellent temper and tender conſtitution of his nature above ours, and his obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to cauſed his inward agony in the Garden.</p>
                  <p>4 It is further evident that God would have Chriſts ſoul to be affected with a deep degree of the dread of his ignominious and unnatural uſage by Satan (even to an eminent Agony) becauſe he appointed him to enter the Liſts, and to combate <note place="margin">Chriſt did not enter the Liſts with Satan in the glorious power of his divine nature, but in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, as it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with our true natural infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious death.</note> with Satan in his true humane nature, as it was accompanied with his true natural infirmities of fear, &amp;c. and not as it was ſometimes accompanied with the power of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
                  <p>For by Gods declared will, Chriſt might not take his utmoſt advantage againſt Satan by arming his humane nature with the aſſiſtance of twelve Legions of Angel; neither might he put forth his omnipotent and abſolute power to deſtroy or anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate Satan, neither might he ſhut up Satan in his everlaſting priſon to hinder him from his encounter, for if Chriſt had put forth ſuch a power as this againſt Satan, the odds had been too great, and ſuch odds given to Chriſt could not ſtand with the wiſdom of the ſupream Covenanters; and therefore in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. God appointed Chriſt to take on him the ſeed of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſinful woman, and in that nature to enter the Liſts with Satan; by the well managing and ordering of which nature better than our firſt parents had done in their innocency, he ſhould prevalle againſt the ſtratagems of the old Serpent, that had the power of death over our firſt parents; and doubtleſs

the Devil made full account to get the like power over the humane nature of Chriſt, as he had done over <hi>Adams</hi> pure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to that end, he did not ceaſe to imploy his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to tempt him, and often times hee heaped upon him many grievous accuſations and ſinful imputations, and at laſt he proceeded ſo far as to apprehend him, condemn him, and crucifie him as a ſinful malefactor; But ſtill the deceiver was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, for indeed, Chriſt was ſuch a wiſe ſervant; and ſuch a faithful Prieſt that he circumvented Satan and all his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by his righteouſneſs in managing the combate accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the juſt laws of the combate, for the Devil could not by all his ſtratagems prevail to make him a Tranſgreſſor, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could not prevail to put him to death formally, by forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his vital ſoul out of his body by all his torments, and this is evident, becauſe Gods Juſtice had not ordained any thing elſe but ſin onely to be the ſting of death; and therefore unleſs Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan could have ſo far prevailed as to make him a guilty ſinner, he could not ſting him to death formally; but himſelf was the onely Prieſt in the formality of his death, and therefore when he was in ſtrength of nature he did but ſay, <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my ſpirit,</hi> and then at that inſtant he gave up the Ghoſt, and that laſt act being done according to Covenant, gave the formality, 1. To his Obedience. 2. To his Death. 3. To his Sacrifice. And 4. To the full price of ſatisfaction to Gods Juſtice for mans redemption.</p>
                  <p>And thus the ſeed of the woman conquered Satan, broke his firſt grand Head-plot by his weapon of righteouſneſs, and won the prize.</p>
                  <p>5 This is no new upſtart doctrine, that Chriſt conquered Satan by righteouſneſs, in obſerving the Laws of the combate, and by entering the Liſts with the infirmities of his humane nature, which was moſt eminently ſhewed both in his internal and external agony, but this doctrine hath been taught by the antient Divines, for.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Chriſt was made man (ſaith <hi>Damaſen)</hi> that ſo that which <note place="margin">Ortho Fidei l. 3. c. 18.</note> was conquered might conquer; God was not unable (ſaith he) by his mighty force and power to take man from the Tyrant, but then that would have been a cauſe of complaint to the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that had conquered man, if he had been forced by (the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:64895:208"/>

                  <p>This (ſaith he) was the great myſtery of godlineſs, that Chriſt was even loaden with injuries, which if he ſhould have repelled with open power, he ſhould have onely exerciſed his divine ſtrength, but not regarded our cauſe that were men; for in all things which the madneſs of the people and Prieſts did reproachfully unto him, our ſins were wiped away, and our offences purged (as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 5.) The Devil himſelf (ſaith he) did not underſtand that his cruelty againſt Chriſt ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw his Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>He ſhould not (ſaith he) have loſt the right of his fraud, if he could but have abſtained from the Lords blood, but greedy with malice to hurt, whiles he ruſheth on Chriſt, himſelf fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth; whilſt he taketh, he is taken, and purſuing him that was mortal, he lighted on the Saviour of the world.</p>
                  <p>And ſaith he, in Ser. 10. Jeſus Chriſt being lifted on the tree returned death on the Author of death <hi>(Heb.</hi> 2 14.) and ſtrangled all the principalities and powers that were againſt him, by objecting his fleſh that was paſſable, and giving place in himſelf to the preſumption of our antient enemy, who ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

                  <p>And (ſaith he) in Serm. 12.

                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks very much to this ſenſe, That Chriſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Devil by juſtice (namely, by combating juſtly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Laws of the voluntary Covenant declared in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.) and not by force (namely, not by the power of his God-head) any man may ſee that his diſcourſe ſounds to this ſenſe; His diſcourſe is long, but Mr. <hi>Worton</hi> hath abbreviated his method, <hi>De Reconciliatione peccatords, part. 2. lib. 1. c.</hi> 21. and there he cites <hi>Bernard</hi> alſo to the ſame ſenſe, and thither I refer the Reader.</p>

                  <p>But the Apoſtle doth make the death of Infants to bee the immediate effect of original ſin, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. and the Devil was the author of original ſin, becauſe it was the immediate pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſin, whereof the Devil was the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and ſo conſequently it occaſioned God in juſtice to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce not only a bodily death, to all the fallen ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> but alſo to denounce eternal death by neceſſary conſequence to ſo many of the fallen ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> as did not beleeve their Redemption by the promiſed Seed; for when God did firſt denounce a bodily death, he did at the ſame time implicitly denounce a judgement, as the Apoſtle ſhews in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27. and to this ſenſe of death doth <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeak, <hi>There is a firſt death,</hi>

I have ſhewed in Chap. 9. that the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary cauſe is never over-ruled by a ſupreme compulſary power: When grapes, or any other thing is preſſed, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſſed to force ſome thing from it: Is this a fit ſpeech to be applied to the voluntary Covenanters, and to the voluntary undertaker of obedience to the Articles of the voluntary Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters; Satan indeed did labour to oppreſs him to force him to impatiency, but not God by his immediate wrath.</p>

                     </p>

                     <p>And now let the judicious Reader judge whether ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of our Saviours Agony, be ſutable to the language of the holy Scriptures, whether he was preſſed and compelled by Gods immediate wrath: And whether his Agony and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict were not rather from the preſſure and compulſion of the Devil, and his inſtruments, according to Gods declared Decree, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and judge if it bee not utterly unlike that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature of Chriſt, as it was accompanied with our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities was able to enter the Liſts with his angry Father, and to be preſſed under his wrath, and to conflict with eternal death, as Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> phraſes are, was his humane nature which was left by his divine nature on purpoſe, that his humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities might appear able to fight it out three whole hours on the Croſs with his angry Father? Perhaps you will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, hee was able, becauſe his humane nature ſubſiſted in his divine: I grant that it alwayes ſubſiſted in the divine, becauſe the divine nature was never angry with the humane; but yet it doth not follow, that it was alwayes aſſiſted and protected by the divine, for then it could not have ſuffered any thing at all from Satan, and his inſtruments: I find it to be an ancient or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Tenent, that the divine nature did often put forth a power to withdraw protection and aſſiſtance from his humane, that the infirmities of the humane might appear; and in this ſenſe his infirmities in his ſufferings were admitted by his divine power: But let it be as the objection would have it, namely, that his humane nature being aſſiſted by his divine, was able
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:64895:211"/>
to induce to bee preſſed under his Fathers wrath. Then it wil follow from thence, that his divine nature did aſſiſt his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature againſt the divine? Is this abſurd language good Scripture-logick?</p>

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 24. If it be true that Chriſt through the anguiſh of his ſoul had clods of blood ſtreaming down his bleſſed body, then doubtleſs it was a miraculous ſweat, and then no natural reaſon can be given as the cauſe of it; but I have all along af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that his Agony was from natural cauſes, and that his ſweat was increaſed by his ſtrong prayers and cryes, and that
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:64895:212"/>
his ſweat was not from the miraculous cauſe.</p>
                     <p>But I perceive that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> himſelf is put in a wavering mind (in p. 66.) whether the ſweat of Chriſt in his Agony was from the natural or from the miraculous cauſe; for when he had expounded his Query, he concludes thus,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We leave it to them that have leaſure and skill to enquire.</hi> And (ſaith he) <hi>Though the Evangeliſt mentioneth it as an effect proceeding from a greater cauſe than the fear of a meer natural death, notwithſtanding</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>our Doctrine is not built onely or chiefly upon this Argument.</hi> Hence,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Any indifferent Reader may eaſily perceive that Mr. <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> anſwer to his own Query is but a very wavering and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed anſwer; and therefore his bold concluſion aforeſaid is built but upon a ſandy foundation, and therefore it is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſatisfie a doubting conſcience.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 This ſpeech of his, <hi>our Doctrine is not built onely or chiefly upon this Argument,</hi> is a plain acknowledgment that the Agony of Chriſt, and his ſweat like blood, is no ſound Argument to prove that Chriſt conflicted with eternal death, and yet in p 70, 39 68, 89, &amp;c. he laies great weight upon his Agony, as a true reaſon to prove that he died as a ſinner imputatively, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed under the ſenſe of the wrath of God, and conflicting with eternal death.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> is wavering in this, that he dares not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that Chriſt ſuffered the Torments of Hell, but by Gods extraordinary diſpenſation, as I have noted it in Chap. 7. Sect. 1.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Hence Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> might as well queſtion whether the firſt touch or real impreſſion of Hell pains would not utterly have diſſolved the link and bond of nature (namely, of the ſenſitive ſoul) that is between mans mortal body, and his immortal ſoul in a moment? Seeing he holds, that his death was cauſed by the wrath of God; For he ſaith, <hi>That his blood was ſhed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the wrath of God, becauſe it was ſhed as the blood of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon accurſed.</hi> For this is a clear Truth, That the vital body of man cannot ſubſiſt under the Torments of Hell, untill it bee made immortal by the power of God at the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Hence it may be propounded as another queſtion of
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:64895:212"/>
moment, whether the Greek word for this bloody ſweat be not ſtretched beyond the Context, as well as hee hath done the word <hi>Amazed,</hi> in <hi>Mark.</hi> 14. 33. as I have ſhewed before.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Hence it may be conſidered what a learned Divine ſaith, There are ſome (ſaith he) that take Chriſts bloody ſweat in that grievous agony to be a ſymptom of infernal pains. But (ſaith he) from what grounds, either in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy or Divinity, I know not. If the pains of Hell, or helliſh pains (ſo ſome diſtinguiſh) be procured by the fire of Hell, (be that material or immaterial) bloody ſweat (ſaith he) can be no probable effect, of the one or of the other fire; nor is ſuch ſweat any <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, or demonſtrative ſign of pains more grievous than may be inflicted or ſuffered by patience meerly natural.</p>
                     <p>For (ſaith he) however in cold Countries bloody ſweats be as rare in mens bodies as ſhowres of blood in the Air. Yet as a good Phyloſopher hath long ago obſerved, To ſweat blood <note place="margin">Curaus.</note> is not uſuall to <hi>Italians,</hi> yet uſual onely, (as I take it) to men of that Climat in ſome particular diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>The moſt remarkable inſtance which I have read of bloody ſweat in a man, not oppreſſed with any diſeaſe, is a Captain, an <hi>Italian</hi> (if I miſtake not) who being ſurpriſed by the ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The conſideration of this perplexity, wherewith (through his own folly) he had intangled himſelf, did make ſuch a deep impreſſion into his generous ſpirits, that it ſqueezed blood out of his veins.</p>
                     <p>(And as this ſudden fear ſqueezed blood out of the veins of this Captain, ſo in Reply 20. I have cited the ſpeech of a Phyſician that ſaith thus, It ſometimes happeneth that ſervent ſpirits do ſo dilate the pores of the body, that blood paſſeth by them, and ſo the ſweat may be bloody.)</p>
                     <p>And ſaith the former Author, our Savior (no doubt) as man had a more deep touch of all the malicious diſgraces, and cruel
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:64895:213"/>
indignities which his enemies could put upon him, than this Captain had.</p>
                     <p>The meaſure of his bodily ſufferings, and perſonal wrongs were in number far more, and for quality more grievous than ever were intended to this Captain, or any other mortal man by their enemies; And though the death of the croſs was in it ſelf an ignominious and cruel death, yet in our Saviors par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular that was moſt true, <note n="*" place="margin">Of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his death, and what I have ſaid on 1 Sam. 31. 4. There <hi>Saul</hi> did ſo loathe to be put to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful death by the mockings of the Philiſtims, that he prayed his Armor-bearer, rather to kill him, as I have noted it in Gal 3. 13. at Reply 6. And <hi>Sampſon,</hi> rather than to live to be an ignominious mocking-ſtock to the Philiſtims, deſired to die, Judg. 16. 25, 26.</note> 
                        <hi>Mortis modus morte pejor;</hi> The manner of his Apprehenſion, of his double Arraignment, and Conviction, of his uſage before he was brought to the place of Execution, and all the time whiles the malice of the Jew and Gentile was wrecked upon him, was more grievous than the death of the Croſs it ſelf, without theſe grievous concommi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, could have been.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 I find that many Divines, though they hold that Chriſt ſuffered in ſoul from the immediate wrath of God upon the croſs; yet they do not hold that his Agony in the Garden was from the ſenſe of the immediate wrath of God upon his ſoul.</p>
                     <p>But his ſorrow and dread there, they make to be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of what he was afterwards to ſuffer upon the croſs; and the fear of that (ſay they) was the cauſe of his bloody ſweat.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Dr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſaith, That the clear ſight and conſiders<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Williams</hi> in his ſeven gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, p 143, 144. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> on juſtific. p. 75.</note> of that cup which he was to drink, was the cauſe of his Agony.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Saith Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> Whiles he hung upon the accurſed tree, he had ſuch a deep ſenſe of the incomparable wrath of God; that the very apprehenſion thereof (before it ſeized upon him) made him ſweat drops of blood.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Saith <hi>George Downham,</hi> The fear of Gods wrath <note place="margin">In his Coven. of Grace, p. 68.</note> when he was in his Agony, cauſed him to ſweat great drops of blood, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 44.</p>
                     <p>And (ſaith he) the ſenſe thereof on the croſs made him cry,

                        <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Saith Mr. <hi>Wall,</hi> In his Agony in the Garden, he ſweat drops not of water but of blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all this in <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Wall</hi> in his none but Chriſt p. 27.</note> expectation of what he ſhould ſuffer, when no hand touched him, but his own thoughts of what he was to ſuffer.</p>
                     <p>I could cite divers others that ſpeak to this purpoſe, But theſe are ſufficient to evidence thus much, that many of the learned do hold, that though Chriſt ſuffered the wrath of God upon the croſs, yet they deny he ſuffered the wrath of God in his Agony in the Garden, and therefore his bloody ſweat is no certain reaſon to prove that he was preſſed under the ſenſe of the wrath of God in the Garden, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> holds, though after he hath affirmed it, he doth again leave it doubtful, which doth not well agree to the property of a Judicious Confuter.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Seeing ſuch eminent Divines as I have above cited, do hold that Chriſt ſuffered the wrath of God (not in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but) on the croſs onely, once for all; It ſhews that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> hath not ſo many Divines on his ſide as he intimates e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and anon, by us, and our, and we ſay, as in p. 44, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8 It is alſo very conſiderable that there are ſundry learned Divines that deny that our Savior ſweat blood, and therefore they do much more deny that he ſweat clods of blood (as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> affirms he did) for the original word, they ſay, <hi>his ſweat was as it were great drops of blood.</hi> And firſt, So ſpeaks the <hi>Greek</hi> Text plainly. And ſecondly, So do our Tranſlators interpret it; And thirdly, Saith Dr. <hi>Hammon</hi> in his paraphraſe on <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 44. He ſweat (as men in agonies are wont) great glutenous drops, like thoſe of blood when it drops on the ground; and ſaith hee in his Annotation, That Chriſt ſweat drops of blood is not affirmed in this place, but only that he ſweat drops of ſweat of a ſtrange thickneſs or viſcouſneſs, and conſequently as big as when blood is wont to fall upon the ground; So ſaith <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Theophylact,</hi> and <hi>Entymius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(And truly I may well adde this, That ſeeing his ſweat was in the open air, and in a cold night, it might well thicken as it ran down his body, and bee glutenous before it fell to the ground.)</p>

That it was for the fear of the pains of Purgatory; Forſooth he that ſhould ſo anſwer, would bee laughed to ſcorn of all the world, as hee were well worthy: Wherefore was it then? <hi>Vetily even for the fear of death,</hi> as it plainly appeareth after; for he prayed unto his Father, ſaying, <hi>My Father, if it be poſsible, let this cup paſs from me,</hi> Mat. 26. 38, 39. So fearful a thing is death even to the pureſt fleſh. And (ſaith he) the ſame cauſe will I aſſign in <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that hee wept for fear of Death, and not of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.</p>
                     <p>In theſe words you ſee that <hi>Friths</hi> judgement was, That Chriſts Agony was for fear, not of a ſpiritual, but of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral death.</p>
                     <p n="11">11 <hi>Tindal</hi> tranſlates <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 44. thus, His ſweat was like drops of blood trickling down to the ground, and ſpeaking of Chriſts laſt Supper, hee ſaith thus, The fear of death was the ſame hour upon him, neither ſlept hee any more after, but went immediately after he had comforted his Diſciples, into the place, where he was taken, to abide his Perſecuters, where alſo he ſweat water and blood of very agony, conceived of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſo nigh at hand.</p>

And when he had three times offered up prayers and ſupplications to him that was able to ſave him from the natural dread of his ignominious tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring death, he was heard and delivered from the natural fear of his vital ſoul, becauſe of his godly fear in his rational ſoul, and then he was confirmed againſt his natural fear; and ſo he never feared more after this, and then as ſoon as he had fulfilled all his ſufferings, he did in perfection of patience and obedience, make his vital ſoul a ſacrifice of Reconciliation for mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
                     <p>This Relation of Chriſts Combate, and of his Agony in his Combate is every way agreeable to the ſcope of the bleſſed Scriptures, and therefore Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> Tenent muſt needs bee dangerous, becauſe he makes this Combate to be between

Chriſts humane nature, and his divine, being preſſed under the ſenſe of Gods wrath, and conflicting with eternal death, and ſo forcing out clods of blood, as wine is forced from the grapes, by Gods preſſing wrath; ſuch expreſſions of preſſing do utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the voluntarineſs of Chriſts obedience in his ſuffering, and do make him to be no leſſe than an inherent ſinner in his Death and Sacrifice.</p>

                     <head>But ſaith Mr. <hi>Norton, It hath two contrary ſignifications. Firſt, Becauſe it ſignifies to help up that which is down, as well as to leave or forſake.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply</hi> 2. I grant that <hi>Azab</hi> by a neceſſary conſequence from the context doth ſignifie helping up that which is down, and in this he alludes to <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 5. and there the words run thus, <note place="margin">Exod. 23. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>If thou ſee the Aſs of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldeſt forbear to help him, thouſhalt ſurely help with him.</hi> I grant that our Tranſlation doth twice in this Text render <hi>Azab, to help,</hi> but yet in the Margin they tranſlate it to <hi>leave,</hi> in both places, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the propriety of the Hebrew, thus, &amp; wouldeſt ceaſe to leave thy buſineſs for him, thouſhalt ſurely leave it to joyn with him; &amp; hence it follows by a neceſſary conſequence, that if he muſt leave his buſineſs to joyn with his hater, whoſe Aſs lies under his burden, it muſt be to help him; and in this reſpect the Tranſlators may well render <hi>Azab</hi> to <hi>help;</hi> And to the like ſenſe
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:64895:217"/>
doth <hi>Ainſworth</hi> tranſlate it in his Annotations, When thou ſhalt ſee thy haters Aſs lying under his burden, then thou ſhalt ceaſe from forſaking him; and hence it follows, that he that ceaſeth from forſaking his hater when his Aſs lies under his burden, muſt needs help him: And therefore in the next clauſe Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> reads it thus, Thou ſhalt leaving leave (th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And according to this ſenſe the Seventy render it thus, Thou ſhalt not paſs by the ſame (that is, thou ſhalt not leave his Aſs under his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) but ſhalt raiſe up the ſame, together with him. And the Chalde ſpeaks thus, Thou ſhalt leave what is in thine heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; and hence it follows, That he that leaves what is in his heart againſt his hater, when his Aſs lies under his burden, muſt needs help him.</p>
                     <p>Therefore from hence I conclude, that the Tranſlating of <hi>Azab</hi> to help, is more from the ſenſe of the Context, than from the proper ſenſe of the word, and therefore though it be tranſlated to <hi>help up,</hi> yet that doth not prove it to have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſenſe to <hi>leave,</hi> it onely proves that <hi>Azab</hi> may be taken in a various ſenſe according to the circumſtances of the Context, where it is uſed.</p>
                     <p>The like he affirms of a contrary ſenſe in other words, p. 48, and he gives three inſtances, To which I anſwer, that they are not contrary, though different in reſpect of the metaphorical ſenſe, and ſo the word <hi>Tzedec Righteouſneſs,</hi> is often put for a counterfeit righteouſneſs, which in proper ſpeaking is untigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in Gods ſight. And therefore the Seventy tranſlate it unrighteouſneſs, in <hi>Ezek. 21. 3. Iſa.</hi> 49. 24. But it is ironically called righteouſneſs.</p>

Margin Tranſlation (which is according to the propriety of the Hebrew word <hi>Azab)</hi> of leaving off to fortifie when they came to the broad wall, becauſe that was done in former times, and was ſtill ſtanding undemoliſhed as the reſt was, and the like ſenſe they give of <hi>Neh.</hi> 4. 2. and the like ſenſe muſt be given of <hi>Azab,</hi> in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 25. and therefore as yet there is no contrary ſignification of the word <hi>Azab,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth make his Reader beleeve; to bewilder his underſtanding, in the manner of Gods leaving or forſaking Chriſt on the Croſs.</p>
                     <p>But for the better finding out the truth, I will firſt give ſome inſtances of the various ſenſe of <hi>Azab,</hi> and then I will examine what ſenſe it hath in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 22. 1.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 It is uſed in a metaphorical ſenſe for a Mart or Fair, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 27. 12, 14, 16, 19, 22. And it is alſo uſed for Wares of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, in <hi>Ez.</hi> 27. 27, 33. And the reaſon is plain, becauſe in Fairs and Markets there is an uſual and continual leaving of one thing for another by way of contract, as of mony for Wares, and of Wares for mony, &amp; of one ſort of Ware for another. So in like ſort the Hebrew word <hi>Gnereb</hi> (which in propriety doth ſignifie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion or con-joyning of two or more things together) is uſed by <hi>Ezekiel</hi> by a Metonymia for Fairs or Markets, and for Wares of Merchandize, <hi>Ezek. 27. 13, 17, &amp;c.</hi> Becauſe of the connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conjoyning of ſundry ſorts of Wares to ſell, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſundry conjunctions between men, by contracts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Wares, as I have ſhewed at large in my Treatiſe of <hi>Holy Time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 As <hi>Azab</hi> is put for leaving one thing for another in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, ſo it is put for any other kind of leaving, either by way of agreement or diſagreement; As for example, when it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that two ſhall ſtrive for the maſtery, there all friends muſt ſtand aſide, and leave their friend alone to try the maſtery, as <hi>David</hi> was left of his friends, when he alone undertook to try maſteries with <hi>Goliah.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4 Leaving is put for forſaking, or leaving another that is helpleſs in their neceſſity. Sometimes it is to leave in anger, as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 25. And ſometimes not in anger but by neceſſity,

I grant that Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> did hold, that God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook or left Chriſts ſoul in wrath, but yet for all that, he was far from holding as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth; namely, that Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the Eſſential torments of Hell. I received ſome Letters from him not many years before his death, about the point of Chriſts ſufferings; And his Letters tell me that he held this as a principle, that Chriſt ſuffered no other afflictions for kind, but what the Elect do ſuffer in this life, though in a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meaſure (now ſeeing he held this as a Principle, he could not hold that Chriſt ſuffered Gods penal and vindictive wrath, except he had alſo held that the Elect do ſuffer Gods penal and vindicative wrath in this life; But ſeeing all the puniſhments of the godly are called but chaſtiſements, even ſo the greateſt of Chriſts ſufferings on the croſs, are alſo compriſed under <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 5.

But yet I grant alſo that Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> held, that as the Elect do often ſuffer Gods wrath, ſo did Chriſt; and in this laſt point I differed from him, for though I hold that Gods chaſtiſements on his own people are from his fatherly wrath, yet I alſo beleeve that Chriſts cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:64895:219"/>
were not from Gods wrath for correction to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as ours are. But from the conditions of the voluntary <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Burges</hi> ſaith well that <hi>Jobs</hi> afflictions were to him as a ſtorm or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt is to a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pilot; or what a valiant Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary is to a ſtout Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on <hi>juſtif.</hi> p. 28. and ſuch was the nature of all Chriſts chaſtiſements.</note> Covenant, Chriſt was to ſuffer chaſtiſements from the rage of Satan, for the tryal of the perfection of his patience and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; and becauſe he continued conſtant in his obedience through all his ſufferings from Satans rage, therefore his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings have the condition of merit.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this, in all Mr. <hi>Ainſworths</hi> five Books on <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> which were publiſhed before this intercourſe of Letters, I find nothing in any of them that Chriſt ſuffered the Eſſential torments of Hell. And therefore Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> was not ſound in the ſenſe of theſe words, <hi>Why haſt thou forſaken me,</hi> according to Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> Tenent, though he was far more ſound than Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> is.</p>
                     <p>2 I can inſtance the like in ſeveral other eminent Divines that held ſatisfaction by ſuffering Gods wrath in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and yet were far from holding as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth, that Chriſt ſuffered the very eſſential Torments of Hell both of loſs and ſenſe, as Mr. <hi>Weams</hi> in his portrature p. 208. ſaith thus, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome things were unbeſeeming to the perſon of Chriſt, as the Torments of Hell, the compenſation of it was ſupplied by the worthineſs of the perſon, and to this purpoſe I could cite <hi>Ball</hi> on the Covenant, p. 200. and others alſo.</p>

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 9. I Have in part ſhewed how in the Dialogue, but I will add ſomewhat to confirm it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Therefore I ſay, that God forſook Chriſt on the Croſs, by not protecting him from the hands of Satan and his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <note place="margin">God forſook Chriſt on the croſs by not protecting him againſt his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſiers.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or thus, God put enmity between the Devil and the ſeed of the deceived woman; and it was agreed between the Trinity from eternity, that Chriſt in his humane nature ſhould try maſteries with the power &amp; policy of Satan and his Inſtruments, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was agreed alſo, that God ſhould leave the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt alone to manage this Combate; and it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed alſo to permit the Devill to uſe all his power and policy, to do his worſt to diſturb the patience of the humane nature, and ſo to pervert him in his obedience, that ſo his firſt Head-plot might not be broken. I ſay in this Combate the God-head was to leave the Humane nature to its own principles, and to permit the Devil to uſe his utmoſt power and policy to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with his Humane nature, and therefore he brought into the Garden a Band of Souldiers, armed with Swords and Staves, to apprehend him, and to bind him like a Felon, and to carry him as a priſoner, firſt before the Prieſt, and then before <hi>Pilat,</hi> and there to lay many criminal accuſations againſt him, and at laſt to crucifie him for a notorious malefactor with all manner of ignominy, and torturing pains; and in all theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious abuſes God did not protect him, nor put out any power
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:64895:221"/>
to deliver him; And thus God forſook Chriſt on the Croſs, and left him helpleſs, as a Combater ought to, be in the trial of Maſteries.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 This expoſition of the word <hi>Forſaken,</hi> muſt needs be the right interpretation, becauſe it agrees to the Context in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. whence it is taken, and therefore I will make it appear by comparing it with the Context.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The next adjoyning ſentence to the word <hi>Forſaken,</hi> is this, <hi>Why art thou ſo far from helping me?</hi> namely, againſt my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Adverſaries; his condition was ſuch that it needed ſome help from God to ſuppreſs them; but it had not been ſo fit to call upon God to help him, to ſuppreſs his own vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative wrath (if any ſuch thing had been) as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> affirms.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The next ſentence doth alſo explain the former; <hi>Why art thou ſo far from the words of my roaring?</hi> for though God had heard his earneſt prayers in the Garden, and had fully delivered his humane nature from the dread of the Cup, yet not from the Cup it ſelf of his ſufferings; and it is alſo cleer by verſe 11. that God heard him in regard of inward ſupport (though not in regard of outwrd deliverance). <hi>Be not far from me, becauſe trouble is neer, and there is none to help me;</hi> that is, be not far from ſupporting my inward man, for there is none to help me in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of my outward man: I know by thy revealed Decree in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. that thou haſt given Satan power over my outward man, to put mee to death as a Malefactor on the Croſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 He prayes again in verſe 19. <hi>Be not far from me, O Lord, my ſtrength, haſten to help me, deliver my ſoul from the ſword, my deſolate ſoul from the power of the Dog.</hi> In theſe words Chriſt doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God to be his ſtrength, even now in this time of his greateſt paſſions: And hence it follows, that when he cryed, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me,</hi> that he felt God to bee his ſtrength in the inward man (at leaſt) though at the ſame time God did forſake him by leaving his outward man into the hands of Satan and his inſtruments, or elſe his mouth, and his heart did not go together, when he did acknowledge God to be his ſtrength, and when he cryed out, <hi>My God, my God:</hi> This appellation ſhews that God was his ſtrength in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:64895:221"/>
man, though God left his outward man to the power of Satan, and his Inſtruments, to crucifie him as a Malefactor; and therefore his next Petition is, <hi>Haſten to help me,</hi> that ſo my body may alſo bee delivered from the power of theſe Dogs, by my Reſurrection on the third day, according to his faith, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 10.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 And laſtly, This is remarkable, that Chriſt did not utter theſe words, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me,</hi> until hee had fulfilled all his appointed ſufferings from the Devils inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as it was declared in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and as they are largely expreſſed in this Pſalm, and therefore the word <hi>Forſaken,</hi> doth relate to Gods outward leaving him in the whole courſe of his ſufferings, from his apprehenſion to his death.</p>

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 10. The cauſe in general was from the voluntary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and Covenant between the Trinity, that ſo the humane nature of Chriſt might fulfil Gods Decree; for if God had not forſaken Chriſt, or left him in the hands of the Devil and his inſtruments; how could <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> with the Gentiles, and the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> have done whatſoever Gods hand and counſel had determined before to be done? <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 27, 28.</p>

2 How could <hi>Pilate</hi> elſe, have had power given him from above to condemn him, if God had not forſaken him, or left him to his power? <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 10, 11. For who is he that ſaith, That any thing falleth out, which the Lord commandeth not? So <hi>Bro.</hi> reads <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 37.</p>
                     <p>3 How elſe could the body of Chriſt have been paſſable, and ſubject to tortures, if the divine nature had not left the humane to its infirmities according to Covenant? for Chriſt was not ſubject by Nature, but by Covenant only to ſuffer afflictions; and therefore the divine nature, did by Contract and Covenant, leave the humane, that it might bee paſſable, and that ſo his obedience to the Articles of the Covenant, might have the condition of meriting.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith in his 60. Tract on <hi>John,</hi> Chriſt was troubled, not through any weakneſs of mind, but of power; Chriſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the affections of fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the infirmities of mans nature, not for want of power to repreſs them, but by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary obedience and humility, that in him they might bee meritorious.</p>
                     <p>4 Chriſt told <hi>Peter,</hi> That he muſt not bee protected at this time againſt the Devil, and his Inſtruments; and therefore hee bid <hi>Peter</hi> to put up his ſword, and not to uſe it for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, ſaying, <hi>Thinkeſt thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he ſhall preſently give me more than twelve Legions of Angels? But</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that ſay, Thus it muſt be?</hi> Mat. 26. 53. 54. <hi>I muſt fulfil all that is written of my ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>

                        <hi>Act. 13. 29. Luke</hi> 24. 26, 46. Therefore neither my Father nor I, muſt countenance the uſe of the ſword for my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; and therefore it is not my Fathers will to give, nor my will to pray for twelve legions of Angels to protect mee from my ſufferings, from Satan, and his inſtruments, for I have covenanted to be the ſeed of the woman, and in that nature to enter the Liſts with Satan, and therefore there is a neceſſity for my divine nature to withdraw, that Satan may do the worſt he can to conquer the patience and obedience of my humane nature, that ſo he may thereby preſerve his Head-plor, if hee can, from being broken, namely, in caſe he can prevail to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb my patience and obedience.</p>

5 With a loud voyce Chriſt propounds this Query, <hi>Why baſt thou forſaken me?</hi> ſeeing formerly till now thou haſt ever protected me againſt the prevailing power of Satan and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 From the womb, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 22. 9, 10.</p>

                     <p>And therefore Chriſt told his Diſciples ſaying, now the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed hour and power of darkneſs is come upon me, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 53. according to Gods declared decree, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and therefore take notice of the true reaſon why God hath forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me, For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Elſe I could not be thus uſed by the powers of darkneſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Elſe I could not be touched ſo deeply with the ſenſible feeling of mans infirmities, as I ought to be.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Elſe it could not be known that I am ſo ſenſible of them as I am, unleſs I did expreſs it by crying out as a man in miſery, <hi>why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4 Elſe it might well be queſtioned whether ever I had a true humane nature or no, if I ſhould not declare my ſenſe of my preſent ſufferings.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Elſe I cannot make it manifeſt that I am a true merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full High Prieſt, except I make it manifeſt that I am emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently touched with a true ſenſe and feeling of mans infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>

                     <p>Therefore that I may make it evident that my humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is thus qualified, I muſt cry out with a loud voyce at the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:64895:224"/>
end of all my ſufferings, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi> or left me to the prevailing powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to indure ſuch an ignominious and painful death?</p>
                     <p>8 It is moſt evident that the laſt extrinſecal part of Chriſts Prieſtly conſecration was ordained to be finiſhed by his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, from the malice and enmity of his proclaimed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Satan, according to <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10, 17. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 8, 9. And this is yet the more to be mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 10.</note> becauſe God ordained that the conſecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, ſhould not be finiſhed without ſome trial of his obedience under ſome kind of affliction, for God commanded them to keep a ſtrict watch at the door of the Tabernacle for ſeven dayes, and ſeven nights together, in all which ſpace they were ſeparated from their Wives and Families, upon pain of Gods heavy diſpleaſure by death; and untill they had mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted the perfection of their obedience under this appointed meaſure of affliction, they might not offer any ſacrifice for the procuring of Gods Attonement, <hi>Levit.</hi> 9. 7. but as ſoon as they were thus conſecrated, then the very next day they were commanded to draw near to God, and to offer ſacrifices of Reconciliation. And to this purpoſe I have given another hint from the words of Mr. <hi>Trap</hi> in Reply 27.</p>
                     <p>Hence I reaſon thus, If the Divine nature had protected the Humane nature of Chriſt againſt the power of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed enemy, Satan, in this appointed hour, for the Prince of darkneſs to exerciſe his utmoſt power againſt, as he did in former times, from the prevailing power of <hi>Herod,</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. and from the prevailing power of his Townſ-men at the hil <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaret, Luk.</hi> 4. 29, 30. and from his conſpirators, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 59. then he could not have fulfilled Gods appointed and declared Decree in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. &amp; his own Covenant, which was, that he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Liſts in his Humane nature, from the ſeed of the woman, with his combater Satan, and give him ſo much liberty as to pierce him in the Foot-ſoals as a ſinful malefactor, and yet that he would continue obedient through all his greateſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and tryals. And his Father covenanted that his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and trials from his Combater, Satan, ſhould be for his ultimate extrinſecal conſecration, and that then he ſhould
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:64895:224"/>
make his ſoul a ſacrifice of reconciliation for the breaking of the Devils Head-plot.</p>
                     <p>Therefore that he might manifeſt the perfection of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience through all his ſharpeſt ſufferings from his malignant Combater Satan, his Divine nature muſt forſake, or reſt, or ceaſe or leave his Humane nature, that ſo his humane nature alone might undergo the combate from the malice of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed enemy, and might manifeſt the truth of his humane nature, by evidencing that he was eminently touched with the quick ſenſe and feeling of our infirmities, and by manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perfection of his patience and obedience under all, before he could make his ſoul a propitiatory ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>And to this ſenſe do the Orthodox ſpeak.</p>

Though that perſon was God and man, yet that hinders not but that his humane nature might make that bitter and lamentable cry from the ſenſe of the Devils ill uſage; his being God and Man in perſonal union, did indeed priviledge his humane nature from ſinful perturbations in his paſſions, and ſo conſequently from Gods coacted Juſtice, but it did not hinder him from his own voluntary paſſions, nor from his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ſufferings from his malicious enemy Satan, nor from manifeſting his true ſenſe and feeling of them, becauſe his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature was no true part of the divine perſon, for then

it could not have been left of his divine nature to ſuffer any thing at all, except Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> will ſay, That his divine nature was paſſible; But becauſe it was no true part, but an Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix only to his divine perſon (as <hi>Zanchy</hi> ſheweth in his.

                     <p>2 I ſay alſo, that the form of this union cannot be exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified from any natural or civil union, and therefore the operations that flew from this union, may well

differ from the operations that flow from all other unions.</p>
                     <p>I grant that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> doth in ſome reſpects fitly exemplifie this union to the union of our ſoul and body, making one <note place="margin">See <hi>Pareus</hi> Notes on <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi> Creed Art. 4.</note> man, but yet in ſome reſpects it will not hold.</p>
                     <p>In two things, ſaith <hi>Pareus,</hi> this ſimilitude doth not agree.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Becauſe in man, by reaſon of the union of the reaſonable ſoul and body, ſome third thing ſpecifically different is made up, to wit, man of matter and form, neither of which alone is man. It is not ſo (ſaith he) in Chriſt, becauſe the word, Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the fleſh was God, and the ſame perſon both before, and after the Incarnation, heretofore without fleſh, and afterwards cloathed with it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Saith he, The ſoul of man receives into it the paſſions of the body, with which it grieveth and rejoyceth, but God, the word, is void of all affection and paſſion.</p>
                     <p>Therefore ſeeing this union is ſo unexpreſſible, the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of each nature may well differ from the operations of all other unions.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Seeing it was the will of the bleſſed Trinity, according to their agreement in the voluntary Covenant, that the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Mediator ſhould keep each nature, and their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties diſtinct: Thence the Mediator might act either as man only, or as God only, or as God and man joyntly: And this obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of neceſſary uſe for the right underſtanding of many Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as it is noted by the Dialogue from Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> in p. 111. and to him I will adde Mr. <hi>Thomas Wilſon,</hi> for in his Theological Rules for the right underſtanding of the Scriptures, hee ſaith <note place="margin">In his 111. Theological Rule, p. 164.</note> thus;</p>
                     <p>Some of the works of Chriſt were proper to his God-head, as his miracles.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Some to his Man-hood, as his natural and moral works.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Some to his whole perſon, as his works of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which each nature did that which was proper to it (but Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> makes no good uſe of this rule.)</p>
                     <p>And all theſe ſeveral operations do ariſe from the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible nature of this union, which doth work according to the agreement of the perſons in the voluntary Covenant: And
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:64895:226"/>
of this I have alſo given a touch before in page 174.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 I have made it evident in the former Chapter, That the moſt excellent temper, and tender conſtitution of Chriſts hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, did make all his ſufferings to be abundantly more ſharp and keen to his ſenſes, than the like can be to us that are by nature born the bond-ſlaves of ſin, corruption, and death; for in that reſpect, our natural ſpirits are of a blockiſh and dull ſenſe, and therefore we cannot abhor miſery and death, with that quick ſenſe and feeling, as the pure conſtitution of Chriſts humane nature might, and did do; and therefore wee cannot cry out with ſuch a deep ſenſe of it, as hee did.</p>

                     <p>So then the operation of his divine nature in this appointed hour, was to withdraw aſſiſtance from his humane nature, and not to protect it as it did at other times, but to leave his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature alone in the combate, and to let the Prince of darkneſs have his full liberty to diſturb his patience, and ſo to pervert his obedience, if he could, or in caſe he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, then it was agreed that theſe trials ſhould be for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of him, as of the Prieſt and Prince of our ſalvation to his ſacrifice.</p>

2 <hi>Theodoret</hi> on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. ſaith, Chriſt called that a derelicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which was a permiſſion of the Divinity that the Humanity ſhould ſuffer.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 <hi>Iſyehius</hi> in <hi>Lev. li. 5. ch.</hi> 16. ſaith, Chriſts Deity is ſaid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part by withdrawing his own power from his Humanity, that he might give time to his paſſion.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The Maſter of the ſentences, ſaith, the Divine nature did forſake the humane nature. Firſt, By not protecting it. And ſecondly, By withdrawing his power that ſo he might ſuffer. And ſaith he, in <hi>lib. 3. diſt.</hi> 2. the Deity ſevered it ſelf becauſe it withdrew protection. And (ſecondly, ſaith he) it ſeparated it ſelf outwardly not to defend, but it failed not inwardly to continue the union.

                     <p n="5">5 <hi>Leo de paſſi Dom.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ibidem,</hi> Chriſt (ſaith he) cried with a loud voyce, <hi>Why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> that he might make it manifeſt to all for what cauſe he ought not to be delivered nor defended, but to be left into the hands of his perſecutors, which was to be made the Saviour of the world, and the redeemer of all men, not by any miſerable neceſſity, but of mercy; not for lack of help, but of purpoſe to die for us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ibidem,</hi> And ſaith he, Let us leave this to the Jews, to think that Chriſt was forſaken of God, on whom they could execute their rage with ſuch wickedneſs, who moſt ſacrilegiouſly deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him, ſaid, <hi>He ſaved others himſelf he cannot ſave.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe laſt words of <hi>Leo</hi> do moſt fitly agree to the Prophecy of <hi>Iſay</hi> in chap. 53. 4. there <hi>Iſay</hi> foretold the Jews, that though Chriſt did manifeſt the power of his God-head in healing ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and carrying away their manifold infirmities from them,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:64895:227"/>
yet out of Satans malice they would eſteem him ſtricken, ſmitten of God and afflicted, namely in Gods anger for his own ſins; and thus the Prophet doth blame their groſs miſtake by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting his ſufferings to be from Gods wrath for his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert.</p>
                     <p>And thus much I think is ſufficient to demonſtrate the reaſon why the Divine nature did forſake the Humane, and why the Humane nature propounded this Query with a loud voyce, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me,</hi> it was, that ſo the humane nature might ſuffer all that was written of him from his Combater Satan, according to Gods declared Decree, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.</p>

Divines do generally account it a moſt impious thing to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that Chriſt was forſaken of God, any of the four firſt waies.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 They affirm that God did not forſake Chriſt in reſpect of union, they affirm that the perſonal union of the two natures was never diſſolved.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 They affirm that he was never forſaken in reſpect of the loſs of Grace.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 They do generally affirm, That he was not forſaken in reſpect of diminiſhing or weakening of any grace in him.</p>
                     <p>But yet ſome there are that do affirm that he was forſaken <note place="margin">The Geneva note on the word <hi>Forſaken,</hi> in Pſa. 22. 1. doth make Chriſt a ſinner inherently.</note> by diminiſhing or weakening of the Grace of Faith in him; The <hi>Geneva</hi> note on the word <hi>forſaken, Pſa.</hi> 22. 1. ſaith thus, Here appeareth that horrible conflict that he ſuffered between faith and deſparation, Is not this a blaſphemous note, to ſay that Chriſt was in a conflict with deſparation through the weakneſs of faith? is not this an imputation of inherent ſin to Chriſt?</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> tels me in p. 215. that the Geneva note which I there cited with approbation to the ſenſe of the Dialogue, muſt not be underſtood in the Dialogues ſenſe, but it muſt be interpreted according to the Doctrine of <hi>Geneva;</hi> I would fain ſee how he by the Doctrine of <hi>Geneva</hi> can make a good expoſition of this note affixed to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 1. if he mean by the Doctrine of <hi>Geneva,</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Calvin,</hi> then I find in <hi>Marlorat</hi> on <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 46. where he cites <hi>Calvins</hi> words on the word <hi>forſaken,</hi> thus, He fought with deſparation, yet was he not overcome thereby; this Doctrine of <hi>Calvin</hi> and the <hi>Geneva</hi> note agree together, and therefore in likelihood that <hi>Geneva</hi> note was taken from <hi>Calvin</hi> at firſt, though his latter Editions are now ſomewhat refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> himſelf doth cenſure <hi>Calvin</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound in this point, for in pag. 61. he blames <hi>Calvin</hi> for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Chriſt ſuffered the pains of the damned and forſaken men.</p>
                     <p>Now if Chriſt was in a horrible conflict between faith and deſparation, as the <hi>Geneva</hi> note ſpeaks, then it follows that he was a ſinner inherently, for if there be any conflict with doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (which is leſs than deſparation) it is a ſin, <hi>Mark. 14. 31. Jam. 1. 6. 7. Matth.</hi> 21. 21.</p>

Truly it is a lamentable thing that this note hath been prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and diſperſed in ſo many thouſand Bibles to corrupt mens minds, ſo that now many can hardly have patience to hear any reaſons to the contrary; but I muſt needs acknowledge that our larger Annotation on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 1. hath made a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Divines confeſs that it was not poſſible that Chriſt ſhould be forſaken in reſpect of aſſurance of future deliverance and preſent ſupport becauſe he had faith in the full Sea without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ebb.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 That Chriſt was forſaken by Gods withdrawing of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward protection (and not delivering of him from the rage of Satan and his Inſtruments untill they had executed on him all their rage) is acknowledged by the Dialogue, and by many Orthodox lately cited.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 The laſt ſort of forſaking is that which is affirmed by Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> namely, <hi>That God forſook Chriſts ſoul in anger, as concerning the fruition and ſenſe of the good of the promiſes.</hi> But in Chap. 4. I have ſhewed that he doth oftentimes leave out the word ſenſe, and makes Chriſt to be forſaken concerning the fruition of the good of the promiſe.

                     <p n="1">1 Chriſt doth interrogate in <hi>Pſal. 22. 1.

not forſake the inward man by any weakning of Grace, nor in reſpect of the comfort of that Grace; and this is evident by what I have cited in my Anſwer to the firſt Queſtion from v. 11. and 19. And alſo I ſhall now add another reaſon by conferring it with v. 24. There Chriſt doth exhort all the ſeed of <hi>Jacob</hi> to praiſe God, <hi>he hath not hid</hi> (or turned away) <hi>his face from him.</hi> Hence it follows by good conſequence, that when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> he could not mean that God had hid (or turned away) his face from his immortal ſoul, for then he could not have exhorted the ſeed of <hi>Jacob</hi> to praiſe God, becauſe <hi>he had not hid</hi> (or turned away) <hi>his face from him;</hi> This very Argument is alſo uſed by our larger Annotation, on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 1. though I did not ſee it, till I had firſt made uſe of it for this expoſition.</p>

                     <p>But this is alſo to be well marked, that when the divine nature reſted, or ceaſed to protect and aſſiſt the humane nature, it did no way withdraw the exerciſe of his inward graces, which he had received at his Incarnation, and at his Baptiſm from the unction of the holy Spirit, above meaſure (as I noted before) by which his ſoul was ſupported under all his greateſt tortures on the Croſs; and therefore as <hi>Stephen,</hi> and many other Martyrs, had the joyful viſion of Gods countenance, and the ſenſe of the good of the promiſes to ſupport their inward man, under their greateſt outward tortures, ſo had Chriſt; though all of them wanted the viſion of outward protection as well as Chriſt, and in that reſpect they might all ſay, as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And as <hi>John

                     <p>In the conflict (ſaith <hi>Ball</hi> on the Covenant, pag. 284.) his Faith was moſt firm, not ſhaken with any degree of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef.</p>
                     <p>And ſaith Dr. <hi>Sibs</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 46. Chriſt was not forſaken in regard of Grace, as if Faith, or Love, (or Joy in God) or any other Grace were taken from Chriſt. O no (ſaith he) he beleeved when he ſaid, <hi>My God, my God.</hi> Unto theſe words of his I put in the Grace of Joy in a parentheſis, becauſe he had ſaid before in general, That Chriſt was not forſaken in regard of Grace, and thence I infer, that then he was not forſaken of the Grace of Joy, in the good of Gods promiſes (for that is one of the Graces, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.) no not then when his ſufferings were moſt grievous to his fleſh, his Joy in the apprehenſion of Gods Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love in his promiſes was not then interrupted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of that his never interrupted apprehenſion, or rather joyful view of the light of Gods countenance, and of the good of his promiſes, he like a conquering Combater <hi>indured the croſs, and diſpiſed the ſhame, Heb.</hi> 12. 2.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Seeing Chriſts ſoul was as full of Grace, as the Sun is full of light, without any eclipſe, and as full of Grace, as the Sea is full of water, without any ebb, as it is acknowledged by almoſt all Divines; how can it be true which Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> affirms, that he was in the ſpiritual death of his ſoul when he ſaid, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> For where there is any true Grace, there the ſoul is ſpiritually made alive, and therefore true Grace is called the Grace of life, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. &amp; where the Spirit of God abides, there the ſoul is in life, and therefore the Spirit of God is called the Spirit of Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. and therefore Chriſt could not be in the ſpiritual death of his ſoul, becauſe he always had the Spirit of Grace in him above meaſure. Abominable then to God muſt that doctrine needs be which Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> hath publiſhed, that makes Chriſts ſoul to be under the power of a ſpiritual death. Some learned Divines do ſay, That none can die the ſecond ſpiritual death in ſoul, before they die the firſt death in ſin, therefore Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> Tenent muſt needs be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox in Divinity, that makes Chriſts ſoul to be ſpiritually
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:64895:230"/>
dead under the pain of loſs and ſenſe; for by that Doctrine, he doth alſo neceſſarily make him to be devoid of all Grace, and ſo conſequently to be ſpiritually dead in ſin, which is hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blaſphemy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 His Tenent in making Chriſts ſoul to be without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of a promiſe, at the very inſtant when he made his ſoul a ſacrifice, doth make Chriſt to be a blemiſhed Prieſt, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, it makes his death and ſacrifice to be an abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God; for a Prieſt that is a mourner in ſoul, is a blemiſhed Prieſt, therefore a Prieſt muſt not be a mourner in ſoul at the time of offering any ſacrifice, <hi>Lev. 10. 19. &amp;</hi> 21. 12. for the time of offering ſacrifice is a time of procuring Gods Reconciliation, and Gods Reconciliation procured is a matter of rejoycing, <hi>Num. 12. 14.

But yet for all this, I ſay alſo, that God did not give the Devil ſo much power as to put Chriſt to death formally, becauſe he had ordained Chriſt to have a Prieſtly power, in the formality of his death, by his unchangeable oath, to the end that he might make his death a ſacrifice of Reconciliation, according to Covenant. But in caſe he had been put to death formally by the power of Satan and his Inſtruments, then his death could not have been a ſacrifice (unleſs he will ſay that God ordained the Devil to be a Prieſt) it could have been no more but a death of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 16. In this ſpeech M. <hi>Norton</hi> doth much wrong the ſenſe of the bleſſed Scriptures, for in <hi>Job.</hi> 10. 17, 18. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement have I received of my Father,</hi> to let none take away my life from me (formally) <hi>but to lay it down</hi> (or as <hi>Tendal</hi> tranſlates it, to put it from me) <hi>of my ſelf.</hi> Hence it is evident that the bleſſed Scripture doth make a plain difference between the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of Chriſts death, and the death of all other men, as I ſhall more at large expounded this Scripture by and by.</p>
                     <p>2 His death is called a ſacrifice, and none could make it to be a ſacrifice but ſuch a Prieſt as was called of God, to be the Prieſt, and no other act could make it to be a ſacrifice, but ſuch an act of ſuch a Prieſt as did formally take away the life of the
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:64895:231"/>
ſacrifice, Therefore he muſt be the onely Prieſt in the formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his own death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 26, 28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. 12. and no other mans death is called a ſacrifice, formally, but his.</p>
                     <p>3 All other men die by co-action, becauſe they are ſinners in <hi>Adam,</hi> but Chriſt was no ſinner, therefore his death was not co-acted by Gods Juſtice as other mens is: But his death was a death of Covenant onely, and that Contract and Covenant made it to be the meritorious price of mans redemption. And to this ſenſe I have cited divers Orthodox Divines, in chap. 2. and in chap. 3. and in chap. 16. at Reply 3, 10, 12. But Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> foundation-Tenent taken from Court. Juſtice, namely, that God did legally impute our ſins to Chriſt, hath ſo beguiled the eyes of his underſtanding, that he cannot ſee the difference which the Scripture makes between the formality of Chriſts death, and the death of other men that are inherent ſinners.

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 17. Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> doth not explain himſelf touching the manner of Chriſts death by this verſe. But in <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. 2. he doth thus explain himſelf; Chriſt (ſaith he) was without yoke, as being free from the bondage of ſin and corruption, and as doing voluntarily the things appertaining to our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: From theſe words of his, I reaſon thus; If Chriſt was free from the yoke of ſin and corruption, and did all things volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily that appertained to our redemption, then his death was not co-acted by Gods Juſtice like to the death of all other men, that are ſinners; his death therefore muſt be conſidered as a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary act from the voluntary Covenant; for as he was an abſolute Lord in Trinity, ſo he was a reciprocal Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 To take our nature, and in that nature to enter the Liſts
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:64895:232"/>
with Satan, and to ſuffer him to do his worſt to provoke his patience, and ſo to ſpoil his obedience (as he did <hi>Adams)</hi> if he could.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 He covenanted that as ſoon as he had fulfilled his utmoſt ſufferings from his Combater, Satan, hee would ſend forth his Spirit as the onely Prieſt in the formality of his own death, that ſo he might make his death to be a ſacrifice of reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for mans Redemption from Satans Head-plot; both theſe acts of his voluntary obedience he performed exactly according to the Articles of the voluntary and eternal Covenant for the meriting of a great reward, namely, for the meriting of the Spirit for Regeneration; and for the meriting of his Fathers Reconciliation, and eternal Redemption of all the Elect.</p>
                     <p>But ſaith the Dialogue, I will diſtinguiſh upon the death of Chriſt, for God appointed him to die a double kind of death, 1. As a Malefactor. 2. As a Mediator, and all this at one and the ſame time.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 He died as a Malefactor by Gods determinate Council and Covenant, and to this end, God gave the Devil leave to enter into <hi>Judas</hi> to betray him, and into the Scribes and Phariſees, and <hi>Pontius Pilat</hi> to condemn him, and to do what they could to put him to death (as a curſed Malefactor) and in that reſpect, God may be truly ſaid to bring him into the duſt of death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. as the Dialogue doth open the phraſe in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 22. 15.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Notwithſtanding all this, Chriſt died as a Mediator, and therefore his death was not really finiſhed by thoſe torments which he ſuffered as a Malefactor, for it was his Covenant to be our Mediator in his death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15, 16. and therefore he muſt ſeparate his ſoul from his body by the power of his God-head (namely, after his Manhood had performed his conflict with Satan) all the Tyrants in the world could not ſeparate his ſoul from his body, <hi>Job.</hi> 19. 11. no, not by all the torments they could deviſe, till himſelf was pleaſed to actuate his own death, by the joynt concurrence of both his natures.</p>

                     <p>2 To the ſame purpoſe Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth thus repeat another ſpeech of the Dialogue; Chriſts death as Mediator (ſaith the diſtinction) was not really finiſhed by thoſe Torments which he ſuffered as a Malefactor; the Jews are ſaid to put Chriſt to death, becauſe they indeavored to put him to death, but did not ſeparate his ſoul from his body; in that ſenſe they did not put him to death.

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 19. I have often warned that the death of Chriſt is more largely or more ſtrictly taken.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The pains of death are often called death in Scripture, though they prove not, in the iſſue, to be death formally.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Dialogue doth all along affirm that Chriſts death
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:64895:233"/>
was a ſuffering, and that he was active in his compliance with all his ſufferings, for he delivered himſelf into the hands of Satan and his Inſtruments, that they might uſe their beſt skill to try if by any means they could diſturb his patience, and ſo ſpoil his obedience (as he did <hi>Adams)</hi> that ſo hee might put him to death, formally, as he did the other Malefact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 It is alſo evident that Chriſt was more intirely active in all his ſoul-ſufferings, than in his outward ſufferings, for the Text ſaith, <hi>He troubled himſelf at the death of Lazarus,</hi> Joh. 11. 33. and he ſighed deeply in ſpirit for their infidelity, <hi>Mark.</hi> 8. 12. and <note place="margin">Chriſt was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicter with ſoul-ſorrows.</note> ſo in <hi>Job.</hi> 13. 21. and from hence I infer, that he was his own afflicter very often, as I have ſhewed more at large in chap. 16. at Reply 10.</p>
                     <p>And to this purpoſe I lately cited <hi>Damaſen</hi> for Chriſts volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſoul-troubles in his Agony.</p>
                     <p>And unto him I will add <hi>Beda;</hi> Jeſus hungred (ſaith he) it is true, but becauſe he would; he ſlept, it is true, but becauſe <note place="margin">See <hi>Beda</hi> in Ioh. 11.</note> he would; he ſorrowed, it is true, but becauſe he would; he died, it is true, but becauſe he would.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ibidem,</hi> The affections of mans infirmity Chriſt took unto him, not by any bond of neceſſity, but by the good pleaſure of his mercy, as he did fleſh, and death it ſelf. Wherefore his death was truly free and not forced, becauſe he had power to lay down his ſoul, and to take it up again.</p>
                     <p>From theſe words of <hi>Beda,</hi> which accord with <hi>Damaſen</hi> and other ancient Divines, we may ſee that they held it to be an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident truth, that Chriſt was often his own afflicter with ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorrows, and to that end he voluntarily took unto him our infirmities of fear, ſorrow, &amp;c. they were not preſſed from him, from the ſenſe of Gods wrath, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> holds.</p>
                     <p>And ſaith <hi>Beda,</hi> his death was truly free and not forced, therefore eſpecially in the laſt act of his death, he was the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly active Prieſt, in breathing out, or ſending out, his ſoul from his body.</p>

There is good reaſon to reject it; for though God commanded Chriſt in his humane nature (as it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with our infirmities) to enter the Liſts with his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Combater, Satan, and alſo permitted Satan to enter the Liſts with Chriſt, and to aſſault him with a Band of Souldiers <note place="margin">Chriſt was not his own execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, or ſelf-murderer, though he was the only Prieſt in the formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his own death and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</note> with ſtaves and ſwords, yet he did not command Chriſt to take any of theſe weapons from them, and run them into his own body, on purpoſe to kill himſelf, that ſo he might be his own executioner (as <hi>Saul</hi> was, to prevent the ignominious uſage of his Adverſaries) this kind of killing is Diabolical; and Chriſt might not be his own executioner in any ſuch like manner; therefore the Dialogue had good reaſon to reject that kind of Tenent.</p>
                     <p>The Dialogue ſaith thus in p. 102. Though he did not break his own body, and pour out his own blood, with nails and ſpear, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers did, yet he brake his own body in peeces, by ſeparating his own ſoul from his body by his own Prieſtly power; And thus <hi>Beza</hi> makes Chriſt to break his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy actively as well as paſſively; But it is a prophane expreſſion to compare the act of a Prieſt in killing a ſacrifice, to the act of an executioner that puts a malefactor to death; and it is a like prophane expreſſion to call ſuch a death Self-murder, or Homicide. If <hi>Abraham</hi> had formally killed <hi>Iſaack,</hi> as he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet he had not been <hi>Iſaacks</hi> murderer, no nor yet his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner, according to the known uſe of the word; neither was <hi>Iſaack</hi> to be called a Self-murtherer or a Homicide, (being now thirty three years old, and therfore able to have reſiſted his Father) in ſubmitting himſelf to be bound, and to be laid on <note place="margin">See <hi>Beza</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. on 1 Cor. 11. 24. And <hi>Haymo</hi> there alſo.</note> the Altar to be killed: But in that act we ſee how God eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, for in that act <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould have been the Prieſt, and <hi>Iſaack</hi> the Sacrifice: And ſo ought we to eſteem of the act of Chriſt in his death, in his Divine nature he was the Prieſt, and in his humane nature he was the Sacrifice (as the Dialogue ſaith)
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:64895:234"/>
or thus, by the joynt concurrence of both his natures, he was both Prieſt and Sacrifice.</p>

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 22. I grant the Scripture doth often ſay, that the Jews did ſlay and murder the Lord of life; but ſaith the <hi>Geneva</hi> note on <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 23. on the word, <hi>you have ſlain;</hi> The fact is ſaid to be theirs, by whoſe counſel and egging forward it was done; By this note it appeareth that in their judgement, Chriſt was not actually put to death by the Jews, but vertually onely; and ſo <hi>Iſaack</hi> is ſaid to have been offered up by <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Preter-tenſe (ſo the new Tranſlation in <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 21.) becauſe he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intend and endeavor to do it. So then, I hope the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue ſaich true notwithſtanding Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> buſling contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; namely, that the Jews did not put Chriſt to death formally. But in caſe he was put to death formally by ſecond
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:64895:234"/>
cauſes, then it follows, that it was done by the Devil in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> powers, for they had the power of life and death at this time, and not the <hi>Jews,</hi> as I have ſhewed at large in the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue; the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> were true murtherers, but not the Prieſt in the formality of Chriſts death and ſacrifice: This diſtinction of his death is contemned by Mr. <hi>Norton.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it is a very harſh ſaying in mine ears to ſay, That the Devil in the <hi>Roman</hi> powers, was the Prieſt in the formality of Chriſts death and ſacrifice, as they muſt bee, if they were the formal cauſe of Chriſts death; and to me it is as hard a ſpeech to ſay, That the wrath of God the Father, was the formal cauſe of Chriſts death, as ſome ſay it was, and as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſaith alſo, ſometimes in true effect; for in page 79, he ſaith, That Chriſts death was joyned with the curſe made up of the pain of ſenſe, and the pain of loſs; and in page 70, he ſaith, It is a fiction to aſſert any divine prediction, That Chriſt ſhould only ſuffer a bodily death, and preſently after he ſaith, Chriſt dyed as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner impuratively, preſſed under the ſenſe of the wrath of God, and conflicting with eternal death.</p>
                     <p>Hence I reaſon thus, If the wrath of God the Father, did put Chriſt to death formally, then the Father was the Prieſt in the death and ſacrifice of Chriſt, which is quite contrary to Gods own eſtabliſhed order; for by his oath hee made Chriſt an unchangeable Prieſt, that ſo hee might bee the only Prieſt in the formality of his own death and ſacrifice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 21.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt was not by nature obnoxious to death, nor to any other miſery, but by Covenant only, and therefore ſecond cauſes could not further work his miſery and death, than he gave way to, according to his own voluntary Covenant; he covenanted to take our nature and infirmities, and in that nature to enter the Liſts with Satan, and that Satan ſhould have full liberty to do to him all the miſchief that he could, even to the peircing of him in the foot-ſoals; but he alſo covenanted, that no man nor power of Satan ſhould take his life from him formally, but that himſelf would be the only Prieſt in the formality of his own death, and according to this Covenant, God commanded him to lay down his own life, and to take it up again, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 17, 18.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="408" facs="tcp:64895:235"/>
But the main Argument of the Dialogue M. <hi>Norton</hi> paſſeth over, &amp; never ſpeaks to it firſt or laſt; which is this, He that takes away the life of a Sacrifice, muſt be a Prieſt; but the death of Chriſt, was a Sacrifice, therefore he that takes away his life formally, muſt be the Prieſt. Hence the Dialogue infers, that the Roman Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers did not take away his life formally, becauſe they were Executioners, rather than Prieſts; neither did his Fathers wrath take away his life formally, becauſe he was not the Prieſt, and none was ordained to be the Prieſt but Chriſt himſelf, and therefore none but he muſt take away his life formally. Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſhould have anſwered this Argument, but he paſſeth by this, and pleads that Chriſts ſuffering of the eſſential curſe of Hell-torments, was full ſatisfaction, and thence he muſt alſo hold, that Hell-torments did put Chriſt to death formally, for there is no ſatisfaction without the formality of Chriſts death, <hi>Heb. 9. 25. Rom.</hi> 5. 10.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1 That the death of the body was inflicted on all mankind for the puniſhment of ſin, in which death, the ſoul muſt depart from the body againſt her will, and not when ſhe would, or as ſhe would.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That the manner of Chriſts death was clean contrary to ours, becauſe he gave up his ſpirit by his own accord and power, when he would, and as he would.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 That his giving up the Ghoſt ſo preſently upon his loud prayer, was wondered at by the ſlanders by, and by <hi>Pilat</hi> himſelf when he heard it.</p>

                     <p>24 Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> in his Marrow on the death of Chriſt, c. 22. comes near unto the former, for in Sect. 27. he ſaith, That Chriſts death was in a certain manner ſupernatural and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, becauſe Chriſt did keep his life and ſtrength as long as he would, and when he would he laid it down <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 18. And in Sect, 2. he ſaith it was an act, and not a meer ſuffering, &amp;c. out of power, and not out of infirmity onely.</p>
                     <p>25 <hi>Calvin</hi> on <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 18. ſaith, Theſe words may be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded two manner of wayes. Firſt, That either Chriſt putteth his life from him, himſelf remaining perfect, as if a man ſhould put off his cloathes. Or elſe ſecondly, That he died of his own accord.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe two ways is active, and the ſimilitude, as if a man put off his cloaths, I conceive is borrowed either from <hi>Auſtin</hi> or from <hi>Bernard,</hi> for both of them uſe this ſimilitude, to ſet out the active ſeparating of the ſoul of Chriſt from his body.</p>
                     <p>26 <hi>John White</hi> of <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> in his Way to the Tree of Life, page 186. ſaith at laſtly, When he was nailed to the Croſs, hee voluntarily breathed out his ſoul into the boſom of his Father, as it is evident, both in that he was dead a good ſpace before the two Theeves that were crucified with him; whereas by reaſon of the ſtrength of the natural conſtitution of his body, he might have ſubſiſted under thoſe torments longer than they; and beſides, by yeelding up his life when it was yet whole in him, as it evidently appeared by his loud cry, which he uttered at the very inſtant of his death, as it is teſtified by <hi>Mar.</hi> 15. 37, 39 and by <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 46. All which are undeniable evidences of our Saviors voluntary reſigning up, <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 46.</note> and laying down his life, according to the will of his Father, for his peoples ſins.</p>
                     <p>And Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> on the Creed, p. 141. agreeth thus far, That the ſtate and condition of our Saviours body (on the Croſs)
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:64895:238"/>
was ſuch, that he might have lived longer; yet ſaith he, by the Council of God, he muſt to die at that place, at that time, and at that hour, where and when he died.</p>
                     <p>And ſaith the Dialogue in p. 97. The Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> was ſent to tell <hi>Daniel</hi> at the time of the Evening Oblation, that from that very hour to the death of Chriſt ſhould be 490 yeers exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut out, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24.</p>

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 24. I grant that about four or five of the laſt cited Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines did hold ſo. <note place="margin">No full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction was made by any thing that Chriſt ſuffered before his death was com.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I ſay alſo, that had they been put to anſwer this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Whether did the formality of Chriſts ſatisfaction lie in his greateſt ſufferings before he gave up the Ghoſt, or in the formality of his death by giving up the Ghoſt? They would
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:64895:239"/>
ſoon have anſwered, That no formality of ſatisfaction was made by any thing that he ſuffered, until he gave up the ghoſt in perfection of obedience, by his own Prieſtly power; and the reaſon is plain, becauſe his death muſt be made a ſacrifice for the procuring of Gods attonement, and there can bee no formality of a ſacrifice, but by giving up the ghoſt; or in caſe any ſhall deny this Anſwer, I beleeve they will intangle themſelves in other inconveniences, that they cannot eſcape, as long as they deny the ſaid Anſwer.</p>
                     <p>2 I ſay further, That the one doth moſt evidently oppoſe the other, namely, in the formality of ſatisfaction, for in caſe <note place="margin">Sometimes Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth place the formality of ſatisfaction in Chriſts ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual death as it accompanied his bodily death, and ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts that, and affirms that Chriſt made full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction by ſuffering the eſſential Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell before he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural death.</note> Chriſt had made full and formal ſatisfaction by ſuffering the eſſential Torments of Hell, before his death was compleated, (as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth ſometimes moſt unadviſedly affirm) then the formality of his death and ſacrifice, was altogether need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as to the point of ſatisfaction, which is high blaſphemy to affirm.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes indeed Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth joyn his ſpiritual death, and his bodily death together, in the point of ſatisfaction, as if his bodily death was cauſed by his ſpiritual death, as in pag. 122, 153, 174, 213, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus he makes Chriſt to dye in a cloud, for he makes the ſoul of Chriſt to depart out of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, under the cloud of Gods vindicative wrath, when he ſaid, <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my ſpirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in page 32. he doth contradict this, for there he ſaith, That Chriſt ſuffered the eſſential penal wrath of God, which (ſaith he) doth anſwer the ſuffering of the ſecond death, before he ſuffered his natural death. And ſaith he in page 150. Chriſt offered himſelf, before his humane nature was diſſolved by death.</p>
                     <p>In both theſe places you ſee that he doth hold, That Chriſt made full ſatisfaction before he ſuffered his natural death (for ſo he doth falſely call the death of Chriſt) And hence it follows, that he doth moſt dangerouſly affirm, that his bodily death in the formality of it was altogether vain and needleſs, as to the point of ſatisfaction, as I have once before noted it in Chap. 4. page 79. And ſaith another learned Divine, This reaſon drawn from the final cauſe of Chriſts ſufferings, is moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory to the infinit worth of Chriſts bloody ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="417" facs="tcp:64895:239"/>
On the other hand, when hee makes him to dye formally under the immediate vindictive wrath of God; Hee makes the Father to be the Prieſt in his death and ſacrifice, which is quite contrary to his own eſtabliſhed order, for he hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Chriſt to bee the only Prieſt in the formality of his own death and ſacrifice, by his oath, which is an unalterable thing; for his oath doth witneſs, that he eſtabliſhed Chriſt by his eternal Decree and Covenant, to be the only Prieſt in his own death and ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>I beleeve it will make Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſweat to get handſomely out of this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> which hee hath brought himſelf into by his own contradictory principles.</p>

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 25. I grant that all the godly ought to ſay to Chriſt <note place="margin">There is a tranſcendent difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the manner of <hi>Peters</hi> laying down his life for Chriſt, and Chriſts laying down his life as a ſacrifice for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the Elect. Joh 10. 11.</note> as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>I will lay down my life for thy ſake,</hi> Joh. 13 37. and they ought alſo to ſay as <hi>John</hi> ſaid in 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 3. 16. For it is the duty of all the godly to venture their lives as Martyrs for the defence of the truth; and for the defence of the godly that ſtand for the truth, if they be called thereto, rather than to deny it.</p>
                     <p>But the death of Chriſt muſt be conſidered, not only as hee was a Martyr from his Combater Satan, but it muſt alſo bee conſidered, as it was ordained to be a Sacrifice of ſatisfaction (to Gods Juſtice for mans Redemption) in the formality of it. In the firſt ſenſe, Chriſt ſaith in <hi>Joh. 10. 11. I am the good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, the good Shepherd giveth his life for his ſheep;</hi> that is to ſay, Hee ſpares not to venture his life to incounter as a voluntary Combater with the proclaimed Enemy (of his elect Sheep.) The old Serpent, according to Gods declared will in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:64895:240"/>
to reſcue, as the good Shepherd <hi>David</hi> did, the prey (or the Lamb which was taken for a ſpoyl) from the Lion, and the Bear, 1 <hi>Sam. 17. 35. Job</hi> 29. 17. And thus Chriſt gave his life as a Martyr.</p>
                     <p>2 But in the ſecond ſenſe, his death muſt be conſidered as it was to be made a ſacrifice of Reconciliation in the formality of it, and ſo it muſt be conſidered as it was effected by his own Prieſtly power, and in that reſpect his death is ſet forth in divers other words in <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 17, 18. to be of a <note place="margin">Joh. 10. 17, 18.</note> tranſcendent nature beyond that voluntary ſuffering, that is expreſſed by <hi>Peter,</hi> or by any other Martyr, as it appears by theſe particulars.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Saith Chriſt in v. 11. &amp; 15 <hi>I lay down my life for my ſheep; I am the good Shepherd,</hi> I will not play the Coward to flye when the Wolf cometh to devour my ſheep, but I will readily and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily undertake to combate with the Wolf for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my ſheep; I am ready to venture my life in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with the old proclaimed Serpent for the reſcuing of my ſheep from Satans ſpoyl, for though I know before hand, by <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. that Satan hath an unlimited power given him to do his worſt againſt me, and to uſe me as a ſinful Malefactor, for a time, which time is truly called the hour and power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 53. yet like a good Shepherd I will readily enter the Liſts with Satan, and will ſo exactly manage the Combate by my humane nature, for the trial of the Maſtery according to the Laws of the Combate, that my death at laſt, ſhall not only bee a death of Martyrdome, ſuch as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of, but over and above, I will make my death, in the formality of it, to bee a ſacrifice of Reconciliation (according to the eternal Covenant) for the full redemption of all my captivated ſheep: I will divide the ſpoyl with the ſtrong enemy Satan; I will redeem the Elect, though he keep the refuſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Chriſt doth ſtill amplifie the moſt excellent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his death, ſaying in verſe 18. <hi>I lay down my life of my ſelf,</hi> namely, by my own will, deſire, and power, according to my voluntary Covenant, for I am a voluntary and equal recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Covenanter, and therefore I muſt never bee over-ruled by

                     <p>Thirdly, Chriſt doth ſtill amplifie the tranſcendent nature of his death, ſaying, <hi>None takes my life from me;</hi> and if none (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome)</hi> then ſurely not death; that ſentence of death that was denounced to ſinful <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. was denounced as a death to be co-acted by the juſtice of God for original ſin; this kind of death could not take away Chriſts life from him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the death of Chriſt muſt be conſidered as a death of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant only; it was founded in the voluntary Cauſe and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to be performed by himſelf as a Prieſt, and to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as a ſacrifice of Reconciliation, as the full price of mans Redemption.</p>
                     <p>But on the contrary, if Chriſt had been our legal Surety in the ſame obligation with <hi>Adam,</hi> then God might in juſtice have taken away his life from him, <hi>volence, nolence,</hi> then God might in juſtice have ſaid to death, Let death ſeize upon him as upon a guilty Sinner, or as on a guilty Surety, and ſo death might have exacted his life from him as a true debtor to death by Gods juſtice, and then his death had been no more but a co-acted natural death, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> makes it to be.</p>
                     <p>But the bleſſed Scriptures do teſtifie that Chriſt in his death did overcome him that had the power of death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. and that he triumphed over Principalities and Powers in it, <hi>Col.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 2 14. Col. 2. 15.</note> 2. 15. The Devil therefore could not put Chriſt to death for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally by his tortures as he doth other men, that are ſinners by Gods legal imputation, and therefore Chriſt ſaid, <hi>None takes my life from me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Chriſt doth ſtill proceed to amplifie the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent nature of his death, ſaying, <hi>I have power to lay it down,</hi> namely, of my ſelf, as he had expreſſed his meaning in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſentence; other men, ſometimes have a great deſire to dye, and to lay down their lives formally, and yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dye according to their earneſt deſire, becauſe they want a power to effect it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jonah</hi> had a great deſire to dye, and yet he had not power to dye, and therefore hee prayed unto the Lord, ſaying, <hi>O Lord, take away my vital ſoul from me,</hi> Jonah 4. 3.

But Chriſt had a power to lay down his life of himſelf, when the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed hour was come, to make his ſoul a ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Saith Chriſt, I have the ſame power to lay down my vital ſoul, that I have to take it up again, and therefore I do compare my power which I have to lay down my life, with my power which I have to take it up again: This ſaith <hi>Origen,</hi> (afore cited) neither <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor any of the Patriarchs, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, or Apoſtles did ſay beſides Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Chriſt doth ſtill make another addition to ſet forth the tranſcendent nature of his death, <hi>This Commandement</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have received of my Father;</hi> no other man ever had, or ſhall have the like poſitive Command to be both Prieſt and Sacrifice in his own death as I have.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Abraham</hi> had offered up <hi>Iſaac</hi> in ſacrifice by a formal death, yet that Prieſt and Sacrifice had been in two diſtinct perſons, and ſo <hi>Iſaac</hi> could not have been a compleat Mediator in his death; But ſaith Chriſt, It is my Fathers Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that I muſt bee the Mediator of the New Teſtament through death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15, 16. therefore I muſt be both Prieſt and <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 15, 16.</note> Sacrifice in one and the ſame perſon, and not in two perſons; This peculiar poſitive Commandement <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Chriſt (ſaith Mr. <hi>Ball)</hi> was Lord of his own life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee had power to lay it down and take it up; And this <note place="margin">See <hi>Ball</hi> on the Covenant, p. 287.</note> power (ſaith he) he had, not ſolely by vertue of the hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical union, but by vertue of a peculiar Command, Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Deſignation to that ſervice, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 18.</p>
                     <p>And ſaith <hi>Grotius,</hi> The death of Chriſt was not determined by any Law, but by a ſpecial Covenant with his Father: And hence it follows, if there had not been a voluntary Covenant <note place="margin">See <hi>Grotius</hi> in his War and Peace, part 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="421" facs="tcp:64895:241"/>
Commandement to lay down his life, muſt not be underſtood of a ſupreme moral Command as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> underſtands it, for in page 103. he ſaith, This act of Chriſt in laying down his life, was an act of legal obedience. And, ſaith he, in page 192. For the Mediator to ſuffer death as our Surety in a way of juſtice, is an act of legal obedience; but by the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement which Chriſt received from his Father, I underſtand the Decree of God, that the conditions of the eternal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhould effectually be performed, cauſing ſuch a thing to come to paſs effectually, and ſo God is ſaid to command his own Mercy, and to command his own bleſſed Promiſes to come to paſs.

And ſecondly, <hi>I have power to lay it down, and power to take it up again,</hi> verſe 18. and they do plainly ſhew, that the true nature of my death, is to be conſidered both as it is a Martyrdome from my malicious Adverſary Satan, and as it is a ſacrifice in the formality of it by my own Prieſtly power: And therefore,</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, In both theſe conſiderations my Father doth love me, verſe 17. and hee hath teſtified his loving acceptance both of my perſon, and of this ſervice of mine.</p>

                     <p>Theſe eight Conſiderations taken from the Text, and laid together, do cleerly evidence, That the manner of Chriſts lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down his life for his ſheep, is of a tranſcendent nature, to the manner of <hi>Peters</hi> laying down his life in Martyrdome for Chriſt, though Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth moſt unadviſedly compare the manner of their death to be alike, without making any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, by which means hee doth beguile both his own ſoul

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 26. It is granted by the Ancient Divines, that Chriſt had voluntary weakneſs, but not neceſſary weakneſs of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the juſtice of Gods curſe, as ſinners have.</p>
                     <p>2 I have formerly ſhewed, That Chriſt was not appointed to combate with Satan and his Inſtruments by the power of his divine nature, but by his humane nature alone, which he vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary aſſumed, together with our true natural infirmities, of grief, fear, ſorrow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that ſo he might bee touched with the ſenſible feeling of our infirmities in all his ſufferings from his proclaimed Combater Satan, and therefore for the better ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of his ſaid voluntary infirmities (for neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities as we have, he had none) his God-head put forth a power to withdraw protection from his humane nature, that
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:64895:242"/>
ſo his humane nature might bee the more ſenſibly touched with the feeling of our infirmities.</p>
                     <p>And withall I ſay, That though Chriſt had this voluntary weakneſs, yet it did not decay his natural vigor by degrees, as the like ſufferings doth decay our ſinful natures, for the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of his humane nature was ſo perfectly orgonized and moulded, that he could at his pleaſure take our true humane infirmities, for the accompliſhing of his Combate, according to the Articles of the eternal Covenant, as he did in his Agony in the Garden.</p>
                     <p>And again, at his pleaſure, he could re-aſſume his perfect ſtrength of nature, as hee did after his prayers in the Garden (as I have formerly ſhewed more at large) he dyed not (ſaith Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> of <hi>Clavering</hi> afore cited) with extremity of pains as others do.</p>
                     <p>And ſaith Mr. <hi>White</hi> of <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> afore cited, by reaſon of the ſtrength of the natural conſtitution of his body, he might have ſubſiſted under his torments longer than the two Theeves.</p>
                     <p>And ſaith <hi>Eraſmus</hi> (afore cited) He did not faint as others do, the ſtrength of his body by little and little decaying.</p>
                     <p>And ſaith Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> cited in the Dialogue, page 101. Chriſt dyed not by degrees as his Saints do; his ſenſes did not decay, no pangs of death took hold upon him, but in perfect ſenſe, patience and obedience, both of body and ſoul, he did, by his infinite power voluntarily reſign his Spirit, as he was praying, into the hands of his Father, without any trembling or ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling, or without any ſhew of the ſenſe of his pains.</p>
                     <p>And ſeveral others both of the ancient and later Divines, I have immediately cited that ſpeak to this purpoſe, which proves that Chriſt had no neceſſary weakneſs to bear his Croſs, but voluntary weakneſs hee had at his pleaſure, that hee might bee truly touched with the feeling of our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
                     <p>And take alſo into conſideration what <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith <hi>de Trinit. lib. 13. c.</hi> 14. where he expounds <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4. thus, even of that infirmity (wherein Chriſt was crucified) the Apoſtle alſo ſaith, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> 
                        <hi>The weakneſs of God is ſtronger than men;</hi> Whatſoever ſeemed weakneſs in Chriſt (ſaith he) is ſo called in compariſon of his
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:64895:243"/>
divine power. And again, his weakneſs was ſuch, that it far paſſed the power and ſtrength of us men, and therefore in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24, 25. Chriſt crucified, is called the power of God, becauſe he was both God and man in one perſon, and therefore as ſoon as he had finiſhed all his ſufferings, wherein he ſhewed <note place="margin">1 Cot. 1. 24, 25.</note> his true voluntary weakneſs; hee breathed out his ſoul, even whiles he was in the full ſtrength of nature, by the joynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of both his natures. To dye, ſaith <hi>Bernard,</hi> is a great infirmity, but ſo to dye (ſaith he) is an exceeding power.</p>
                     <p>Hence then I conclude, That when the Executioners did compel a man of <hi>Cyren</hi> to bear his Croſs, that is, to help him bear it: It doth not prove that Chriſt had leſs ſtrength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture left to bear it than the Theeves had, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue; it proves no more but this, either that Chriſt had volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary weakneſs, or elſe that they thought him to have ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary weakneſs appertaining to his nature, as other ſinful men have that are over-burdened, for they could not diſcern his voluntary weakneſs, from neceſſary weakneſs, unleſs they had known him to be God and man in one perſon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they compelled a man of <hi>Cyren</hi> to help him bear his Croſs; And who can tell but that the Theeves had ſome to help them bear their Croſs as well as Chriſt had? and therefore it is a weak argument to prove that Chriſt had leſs ſtrength of nature to bear his Croſs, than the two Theeves, becauſe they compelled a man of <hi>Cyren</hi> to help him bear his Croſs; ſeeing the Scripture is ſilent whether the two Theeves did bear their own Croſs, without any help from others.</p>

                        <hi>Reply</hi> 27. I have often warned, to have it the better marked, That the death of Chriſt is ſet out to us two wayes in the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Either more largely by his ſuffering the pains of death, as a ſinful Malefactor from his envious Combater Satan.</p>
                     <p>Or ſecondly, more ſtrictly, by ſetting out the formality of his death, as it was made a ſacrifice, when his ſoul was ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his body by his own Prieſtly power.</p>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> is much diſpleaſed with this diſtinction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it croſſeth his Doctrine of Satisfaction, by ſuffering the eſſential Torments of Hell, as our legal Surety in the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation with <hi>Adam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now in the firſt ſenſe it is true, That Chriſt was ordained to be the ſeed of the ſinful deceived woman, and in that nature, as it was accompanied with our true humane infirmities, hee was to combate with our malicious Enemy Satan; and in that reſpect he muſt permit the courſe of Phyſical cauſes, and the prevailing power of the Prince of darkneſs to do him all the miſchief he could to provoke his patience, and to diſturb him in the courſe of his obedience according to Gods Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Combate in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
                     <p>2 But yet notwithſtanding, it is not any where written, that Chriſt covenanted to let the powers of darkneſs to take away his life formally: I do not find that Chriſt had limited him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his obliged permiſſion to let the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> take away his life actually and formally, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> holds: Nay, I ſay, the bleſſed Scriptures do plainly deny this, as I have opened <hi>Job.</hi> 10. 17, 18. in <hi>Reply</hi> 25.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is alſo further evident, that none but himſelf was ordained to bee the Prieſt in the formality of his Death and Sacrifice, becauſe God made him a Prieſt for ever after
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:64895:244"/>
the order of <hi>Melchlſedek</hi> by an oath, which declares, That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the eternal Decree, and the unchangeable Council <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 21.</note> and Covenant of God, he ſhould be the only Prieſt in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of his death and ſacrifice; and in that reſpect Chriſt ſaith, <hi>None taketh my vital ſoul from me, I lay it down of myſelf, I have power to lay it down, and power to take it up again; This Commandement have I received of my Father,</hi> Joh. 10. 17, 18. <note place="margin">Joh. 10. 17, 18.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>And hence I reaſon thus, If Chriſt received this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from his Father, then doubtleſs his Father had covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he ſhould be the only Prieſt in the formality of his own death and ſacrifice, and that he would accept it as the full price of mans Redemption.</p>
                     <p>3 I have often ſhewed that Chriſts humane nature was ſo perfect, that it was priviledged from our natural death and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; and that his death and ſufferings was undertaken only by his voluntary Covenant; and that Covenant made it upon performance according to the Articles, to be the full price of mans Redemption.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two wayes the bleſſed Scriptures do often ſpeak of the death of Chriſt. Firſt, Of his paſſive death.</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly, Of his active death: But becauſe his paſſive death from his malignant Combater Satan, was accompanied with very many ignominous puniſhments and reproachful Tortures which he was permitted to uſe, as thinking thereby to provoke his patience, and ſo to ſpoil his obedience, that ſo he might not make his ſoul a ſacrifice: Therefore much Scripture is taken up to record the long ſtory of his paſſive death, and in that long and ſharp trial, his perfect patience and obedience, through all his ignominious ſufferings, is much to be admired, eſpecially from the time that he was apprehended to the end of the time of his crucifying, which was twelve full hours, and hee aboad under the pains of a violent death for three hours together; and all the actions that fell in about his ſufferings in all this time were many, and therefore the ſtory thereof muſt needs bee long, and his ſenſible feeling of our infirmities in all his ſufferings, doth not only prove the truth of his humane nature, but the perfection of his patience and obedience; and in that reſpect his ſufferings were ordained to be for the perfection of his Prieſtly Conſecration to his
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:64895:244"/>
ſacrifice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. And therefore as ſoon as he had finiſhed his Prieſtly Conſecration by ſuffering the utmoſt of Satans temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 10. Chriſts Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Chriſts Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note> and trials, he preſently after, without delay, made his vital ſoul a ſacrifice by his Prieſtly power in both his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as the formality of all ſatisfaction for mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe this ſhort ſingular act of his ſacrifice, was done as it were but in a moment of time, and becauſe it was done in the middeſt of his ſenſible torments on the Croſs; therefore it comes to paſs, that this ſhort ſingular act of his ſacrifice is not ſo much marked as it ought to bee. But, moſt an end, the long obvious ſtory of his ſufferings from his Combater Satan (which indeed doth belong to his ſacrifice, as much as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of the Prieſt doth to the Sacrifice) is named inſtead of full ſatisfaction, and ſo it may be juſtly called by the figure Synecdoche, provided his ſacrifice, in the formality of his death, by his own Prieſtly power be not neglected; but a real diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ought to be obſerved when the parts of Chriſts Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, are to be explained, though this diſtinction is often ſleighted and divided by Mr. <hi>Norton.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So then from the long paſſive action, Chriſt may bee truly ſaid to be killed and ſlain (for he was crucified with the ſores of death) even as truly as it is ſaid that Chriſt was the Son of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> for indeed he was the Son of <hi>Joſeph</hi> in a true legal ſenſe, becauſe he was born of <hi>Joſephs</hi> wife after Manage, and in that reſpect, he was truly and properly, in Laws eſteem, the Son of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and accordingly he was every where eſteemed, and called the Son of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> yea his mother <hi>Mary,</hi> that beſt knew the truth, told her Son Jeſus, that his Father <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſought after him, <hi>Luke.</hi> 2. 48. yea and Jeſus himſelf did alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>Joſeph</hi> to be his true Father, according to Laws eſteem, and therefore he was ſubject to him as to his proper Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for nine and twenty years together; namely, until he was extrinſecally inſtalled into the Mediators office (and then he had the buſineſs of another Father to do) and the world in general (ſome few excepted) knew no other, but that he was the true natural Son of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and herefore no man did contradict that uſual talk and ſpeech; and yet notwithſtanding all this plain and downright ſpeaking, Chriſt was not the true natural Son
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:64895:245"/>
of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> hee was legally, but not formally the Son of <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So in like ſort it may be as truly ſaid, That Chriſt was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ſlain by the ſores of death on the Croſs by the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe they did as much to kill him, as they did to kill their own Prophets, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 15. yea Chriſt himſelf foretold his Diſciples that he ſhould be killed by the <hi>Jews, Mark. 8. 31. Mark.</hi> 12. 8. and all the Prophets ſaid, It ſhould be ſo, <hi>Gen. 3. 15. Pſol. 22. Iſa.</hi> 53. and the Evangeliſts ſaid, It was ſo, <hi>Luke 24. 20. Act.</hi> 2. 23. and the Martyrs in <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 9, 12. ſaid, It was ſo; and yet in verſe 6. they ſay alſo that he ſtood there, as though hee had been killed; both ſpeeches are true, and both are truly affirmed; For firſt, He was truly killed and ſlain both by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and by the <hi>Roman</hi> powers, in Laws eſteem; and yet the Martyrs ſaid, It was but as though it were ſo; legally they killed him, but formally they did not kill him (though they did what they could to kill him formally, and they thought they had killed him formally, becauſe he died formally whiles he was under the ſores of death) but indeed they could not kill him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, becauſe God had given power to Chriſt to lay down his life formally of himſelf, and that no other created power ſhould take away his life from him, as I have formerly expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Job.</hi> 10. 17, 18. Himſelf was ordained to be the only Prieſt in the formality of his death and ſacrifice, as ſoon as he had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled al the tortures of the Croſs from his Combater Satan, but that act of ſeparating his ſoul from his body; was not ſo ſenſible to the beholders as his external tortures of death were, and therefore they thought nothing leſs was the true cauſe of his death.</p>
                     <p>They could not by the power of their natural reaſon diſcern how God did interpoſe his power between the tortures of death, and their ordinary killing effect, neither could they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the difference that was between his ſinleſs nature, and their own corrupt nature, nor yet how he was God and man in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal union, and therefore they could not know as they ought to have known, how he muſt be the only Prieſt in the formality of his own death and ſacrifice, and that he muſt offer himſelf by his eternal Spirit, that ſo he might be the Mediator of the New Teſtament through that kind of Mediatorial death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14, 15.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="429" facs="tcp:64895:245"/>
And yet this ignorance both of the Jews and Romans did no whit exempt them from being the true murderers of the Lord of life, in as high a degree, as if his God-head had not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to hinder their killing power; as we may ſee by that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent example of Juſtice that was done by <hi>Darius</hi> upon ſuch like murderers of <hi>Daniel;</hi> for after that <hi>Darius</hi> was come to the Lyons Den, and perceived that God had interpoſed his power, between the fierce devouring nature of the ravenous Lyons, and their executive power, and that <hi>Daniel</hi> was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally killed by them, he did not in that reſpect excuſe <hi>Daniels</hi> accuſers from being the true murderers of <hi>Daniel;</hi> but on the contrary, he did adjudge them to be <hi>Daniels</hi> true murderers, and therefore he commanded them to be thrown into the Lions Den, and to be killed as the true murtherers of <hi>Daniel,</hi> in Laws eſteem, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 22, 23, 24. <note place="margin">Dan. 6. 22, 23, 24.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>4 In caſe Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> will ſtill deny this Prieſtly power to Chriſt in the formality of his death and ſacrifice, then why hath he not hitherto made it evident by Scripture, rightly expounded, how elſe Chriſt was the onely Prieſt in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of his death and ſacrifice? ſeeing the Dialogue did give him juſt occaſion to clear this point more fully than as yet he hath done.</p>
                     <p>I find that ſome eminent Divines do make his own ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be put to death formally, by the Devils Inſtruments, to be his onely prieſtly act in his ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>But for the reaſons fore-alledged from <hi>Job.</hi> 10. 17, 18. and from <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14, 15, 16. It is ſtill evident to me that his act of ſubmiſſion to be put to death by the Devils Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is not ſufficient to demonſtrate his active prieſtly power, and authority, for the making of his death to be a mediatorial ſacrifice; for then the ſubmiſſion of Martyrs to be put to death by Tyrants, might as well be called their Prieſtly power to make their lives a ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>But I have formerly ſhewed, Firſt, That no other death can <note place="margin">No other act of a Prieſt doth make a ſacrifice but ſuch an act as doth-formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take away the life of the ſacrifice.</note> properly be called a ſacrifice but ſuch a death onely as is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally made by a Prieſt, namely, by ſuch a Prieſt as God hath deſigned for that work.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That no other act of that Prieſt can make it to bee a ſacrifice formally, but ſuch an act as doth formally
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:64895:246"/>
take away the life of the appointed ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>5 Saith Mr. <hi>Trap</hi> on <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. The Prieſt was firſt conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 10. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Lev. 8. 30.</note> with oyle, and then with blood; this I do the rather men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the better conſideration of the nature of Chriſts Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration to his Prieſtly Office.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He was annointed with the oyl of gladneſs, when he was firſt extrinſecally inſtalled into the Mediators Office at his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, by the apparition of the Holy Ghoſt in ſhape like a Dove, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, After this he was Conſecrated with blood, in all his bloody ſufferings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10, 17. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9.</p>
                     <p>6 Every conſecrated Prieſt muſt have ſome good thing to offer to the offended party for his reconciliation to the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 3. and none knows what good thing will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to our offended God but himſelf; and therefore, he onely muſt both ordain the Prieſt, and the manner of his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, and the good thing that he will accept, and the manner of the offering it.</p>
                     <p>And therefore it pleaſed God in the firſt Covenant to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain typical Prieſts that had ſinful infirmities, and typical cleanſings by the aſhes of an Heifer, and by the blood of beaſts, for the cleanſing and purifying of the fleſh from Ceremonial ſins: And theſe beaſts he appointed to be, Firſt, of the gentle and harmleſs kinds, and ſuch as would continue patient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ill uſage. Secondly, To be ſuch as were without ſpot out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. And thirdly, To be ſuch as were without blemiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; that ſo they might be types of the perfection of Chriſts humane nature, and of his ſacrifice, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. as the onely good things which he had ordained to be offered by his Prieſtly power, to purge the conſcience from all our moral ſins and ſo to bring us again to God, as the Dialogue hath ſhewed in p. 91, &amp;c. Therefore when he came into the world, he ſaid, <hi>Sacrifice and Offering thou wouldest not have, but a body haſt thou prepared me.</hi> God that was offended (knew beſt what good thing would be moſt acceptable unto him for the procuring of his reconciliation) prepared a body for Chriſt that ſo it might be that worthy thing (that from eternity he had appointed to be offered in the fulneſs of time.) And therefore in the fulneſs of time Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Lo, I come to do thy acceptable will, O God;</hi>
                        <pb n="431" facs="tcp:64895:246"/>
and ſo he took away the firſt typical Prieſts and ſacrifices, that he might eſtabliſh the ſecond to ſtand for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5. 6, 7, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>By which will of God, thus performed by Chriſt, in making his prepared body a ſacrifice, we are ſanctified or made holy and righteous again, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10. namely, ſet into a ſtate of favour, <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 10. The word San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie and make holy, in the Law, is often aſcribed to Gods attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſinners that are ſo made holy are juſtified and righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Gods ſight.</note> as we were in our firſt creation; for ſo we muſt underſtand the word <hi>ſanctified,</hi> and ſo the legal phraſe in the word <hi>[ſanctifieth]</hi> to the purifying of the fleſh in verſ. 13. doth teach us to carry the ſenſe, and how elſe did the offering of Chriſts body (ſanctifie or) purge the conſcience, as the word is in ver. 14. from dead works (that is to ſay from original and actual ſin?) But becauſe God was pleaſed to ordain that offering to be the onely meritorious procuring cauſe of his reconciliation, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, pardon and forgiveneſs; So then it is Gods At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, ſo procured, that did ſanctifie the ſinner or make him holy and righteous in Gods ſight, in reſpect of his ſtate (in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Gods favor) even as <hi>Adam</hi> was in his firſt Creation; and the reaſon is ſo plain, that he that is but obſervant of the typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal phraſes may run and read it; namely, becauſe originally God created the nature of all mankind in holineſs and righteouſneſs, after his own image; for in caſe <hi>Adam</hi> had but firſt eaten of the Tree of life, all his children ſhould have been holy, but in caſe he did firſt eat of the forbidden fruit, then he and all his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould with him forfeit their creative purity, and inſtead thereof become dead in ſin, and ſo be in a ſtate of enmity with God; but by Gods reconciliation and attonement procured through the ſacrifice of Chriſt, all their ſins ſhould be forgiven, and ſo they ſhould be again reſtored into their former eſtate of holineſs and righteouſneſs, namely, into Gods gracious favour again, as <hi>Adam</hi> was in his innocency.</p>
                     <p>And ſaith <hi>Baxter</hi> to <hi>Molivaeus,</hi> p. 181. It is the ſame act of God that is called conſtitutive juſtification and pardon of ſin, ſo far as Juſtification is taken, as comprehending one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the reſtoring of us to the happineſs that we fell from.</p>
                     <p>But this I perceive is a Riddle to Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> for in p. 209. he ſaith, to be ſinleſs is not enough to make a ſinner righteous; but if he will but ſearch better into the Ceremonial Types, he may ſee that it is Gods forgiveneſs from his attonement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured

Even ſo it muſt be underſtood in the typical ſenſe, and therefore as often as Gods holy people were legally defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, what did God require them to do to make them holy and righteous again? but to obſerve the Laws of their legal waſhings, and cleanſings, which God ordained on purpoſe for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of his attonement, pardon and forgiveneſs, and then they were made holy again, or then they were ſanctified to the purifying of their fleſh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13. <hi>Lev.</hi> 11. 44. <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. 8, 9, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 2. 21. <hi>and</hi> 26. 16, 19, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 31. <hi>Lev.</hi> 17. <hi>and</hi> 20. 25, 26.

                     <p>But this is needful to be remembred, that this kind of holineſs and ſanctity by Gods attonement, procured by their legal waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſacrifices, muſt be diſtinguiſhed from that kind of ſanctity and holineſs that is firſt wrought in us by Gods Spirit in our Regeneration; For this kind of holineſs which we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by Gods Reconciliation, Attonement, Pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, may more fitly be called, The ſatisfaction of merit.</p>

from dead works, and therefore in verſe 14. the Apoſtle doth infer from verſe 13. <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who offered himſelf by his eternal Spirit, purge your conſcience from dead works?</hi> (and here it muſt be noted that the word <hi>Purge</hi> in ver. 14 is of the ſame force with the comparative word <hi>Sanctifie,</hi> in ver. 13. and with the word <hi>ſanctifie</hi> in chap. 10. 10.) and alſo from this act of Chriſt in offering himſelf by his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſpirit in ver. 14.

                     <p>Fifthly, It is alſo evident by the New Teſtament, that Gods Reconciliation or Attonement procured by the death of Chriſt, doth make beleeving ſinners holy and righteous, as in <hi>Col. 1. 21, 22.

                     <p>Sixthly, I pray note this alſo, That the holineſs of Chriſts perſon cannot be imputed to us for our formal holineſs (as it is affirmed by ſome) unleſs it could be proved that God doth firſt make us one with Chriſt in the perſonal unity of both his natures, as the Dialogue doth reaſon the caſe in p. 146. And ſo Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth reaſon with <hi>Molinaeus</hi> in p. 183. Chriſts Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs formally (ſaith he) is incommunicable to any other;

                     <p>And why then doth Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> detract ſo much from the perfection of his Prieſtly action, in the formality of his death and ſacrifice, by aſcribing the formality of it to phyſical cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes onely, as his words repeated a little before do teſtifie?</p>

I cannot but wonder that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſhould detract ſo much from the perfection of Chriſts Prieſtly action in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his death to be a ſacrifice, as to make it to be nothing elſe but a co-acted death according to Gods ſentence denounced on fallen <hi>Adam,</hi> as the puniſhment of his original ſin in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. For as <hi>Lupſet</hi> ſaith well, In our death, the body doth in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner leave the ſoul, before the ſoul leaveth the body, For (ſaith he) it is the body by it ſelf, forſaking life, that cauſeth the ſoul to depart. Hence I infer, What perfection of Chriſts Prieſtly active obedience can there be in ſuch a kind of forced death, as this is?</p>
                     <p>But on the other hand, look upon the death of Chriſt as it was to be made a ſacrifice in the formality of it by his own Prieſtly power, and then we may ſee it to be a death of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant onely, and ſo conſequently to be an active mediatorial death and ſacrifice, becauſe hee muſt bee our Mediator in his death. But in Reply 16. I have ſpoken more fully to this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 Hence it follows, That God did not forſake Chriſt in the formality of his death on the Croſs, namely, he did not ſo forſake him, as to ſuffer his humane nature to be put to death formally by the power of Satans torturing pains, neither did he appoint his death to be made a ſacrifice by his own immediate wrath, but onely by Chriſts own Prieſtly power.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Hence it follows, That the death of Chriſt in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of it, was accepted of God as a Mediatorial ſacrifice of Reconciliation, by which his wrath was appeaſed, and his favour procured to all poor humbled and beleeving ſinners; he was the Mediator of the New Teſtament through his death, becauſe he compleated the ſame as our Mediatorial Prieſt by the joynt concurrence of both his natures in perſonal union, and in that reſpect, he is denominated to be the Mediator of the New Teſtament, through that tranſcendent kind of death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14, 15, 16.</p>
